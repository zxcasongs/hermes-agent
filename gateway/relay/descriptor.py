"""CapabilityDescriptor — the relay handshake payload. EXPERIMENTAL.

The connector hands a ``CapabilityDescriptor`` to the gateway's ``RelayAdapter``
at handshake time; it tells the adapter which platform it is fronting and which
capabilities to advertise to the ``GatewayStreamConsumer`` (char limit,
draft-streaming, edit/threading support, markdown dialect, length unit). It is
the linchpin of the generalization: one gateway adapter serves Discord,
Telegram, Matrix, Signal, ... without per-platform branching.

EXPERIMENTAL: this schema MAY CHANGE without a deprecation cycle until at least
two real Class-1 platforms have validated it. Evolution during the experimental
phase is additive-only, gated by ``contract_version`` (see
docs/relay-connector-contract.md).

Field origins (most are a wire-serializable projection of ``PlatformEntry`` plus
the per-instance capability methods on ``BasePlatformAdapter``):

- ``max_message_length`` -> ``PlatformEntry.max_message_length`` / adapter
  ``MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH`` attribute (read by stream_consumer).
- ``len_unit``           -> selects which ``message_len_fn`` the adapter installs
  ("chars" = builtin len; "utf16" = Telegram-style UTF-16 code-unit counting).
- ``supports_draft_streaming`` -> adapter ``supports_draft_streaming()`` probe.
- ``supports_edit``      -> whether edit-based streaming is possible (Discord/
  Telegram yes; Signal/SMS no -> consumer degrades to one-message-per-segment).
- ``supports_threads``   -> ``create_handoff_thread`` capability flag.
- ``markdown_dialect``   -> presentation hint (e.g. "markdown_v2", "discord").
- ``emoji`` / ``platform_hint`` / ``pii_safe`` -> ``PlatformEntry`` fields of the
  same name.
