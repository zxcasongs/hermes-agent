"""RelayAdapter — one generic gateway adapter fronted by the connector. EXPERIMENTAL.

A single ``BasePlatformAdapter`` subclass that, at handshake, receives a
``CapabilityDescriptor`` from the connector telling it which platform it is
fronting and which capabilities to advertise to the ``GatewayStreamConsumer``.
It implements the four abstract methods (``connect`` / ``disconnect`` / ``send``
/ ``get_chat_info``) plus the capability surface (``MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH``,
``message_len_fn``, ``supports_draft_streaming``) by delegating wire I/O to an
injected transport and reading capabilities off the descriptor.

There is NO per-platform gateway code: the connector is the only side that knows
"this chat_id maps to a Discord channel, send it via the Discord websocket."
The gateway sees an ordinary ``MessageEvent`` in and calls ``adapter.send`` out.

EXPERIMENTAL: the transport protocol and descriptor schema may change without a
deprecation cycle until >=2 Class-1 platforms validate them.

        message's ts (the stream consumer's ``initial_reply_to_id``, used as the
        edit anchor and, on threading platforms, the reply target). The
        connector's slackRestSender maps a raw ``reply_to`` to a Slack
        ``thread_ts``, so a plain DM reply would be posted THREADED under the
        user's message instead of flat at the DM root — and a threaded first
        send loses the progressive edit-streaming the user sees in a real
        thread (the reported symptom: DM/home replies arrive flat, no
        progressive edits).

        Native Slack Hermes already suppresses this synthetic DM thread anchor:
        ``SlackAdapter._resolve_thread_ts`` returns ``None`` for a top-level /
        DM message when ``reply_in_thread`` is off. The relay lane has no such
        disambiguation, so we reproduce it here. run.py already encodes the
        real-thread decision in ``metadata["thread_id"]`` (it is set only when
        progress threading is active — a real thread, or channel autoThread);
        for a DM with no real thread that key is absent. So the rule is:

          Slack DM + no real ``thread_id`` in metadata  ⇒  drop ``reply_to``.

        This posts the reply flat at the DM root and lets the consumer edit its
        own first-send ts — streaming works exactly as in a thread. It does NOT:
          * reintroduce a synthetic DM thread_id (#18859 / the /sethome
            landmine) — it removes an anchor, never adds one;
          * regress real-thread streaming — a real thread carries a distinct
            ``thread_id`` in metadata, so the guard leaves ``reply_to`` alone;
          * regress channel autoThread — a channel/group top-level reply carries
            ``thread_id`` (the message's own ts) in metadata when threading is
            on, so it is left alone; and a non-DM chat is never matched here.
