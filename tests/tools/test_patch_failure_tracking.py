"""Tests for per-file consecutive patch-failure tracking.

When the agent repeatedly fails to patch the same file with similar but
non-matching old_strings, it's usually stuck in a loop with a stale view
of the file.  After 3 consecutive failures on the same path, the patch
tool injects an escalating ``_hint`` that tells the model to break out
of the loop (re-read, use longer context, or fall back to write_file).

See issue #507 (Roo Code deep-dive, item 2f).
