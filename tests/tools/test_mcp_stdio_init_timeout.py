"""Regression test for the stdio-MCP subprocess/FD leak (#59349).

A stdio MCP server that never completes ``initialize`` (e.g. emits a
non-JSON-RPC frame and then blocks on stdin) used to hang ``_run_stdio``
forever on the background event loop: ``connect_timeout`` bounded only the
*caller's* ``.result()`` wait, not the coroutine itself. Because the connect
never unwound, the cleanup ``finally`` in ``_run_stdio`` never ran, so the
spawned child process and its stdio pipes / pidfd leaked on *every* discovery
retry — unbounded, until the gateway hit EMFILE.

The fix wraps ``session.initialize()`` in
``asyncio.wait_for(..., timeout=connect_timeout)`` so a stalled handshake fails
instead of hanging, which lets the existing ``finally`` reap the child.

This test drives the *real* ``_run_stdio`` with a fake transport whose
``initialize()`` hangs, and asserts the connect is bounded by
``connect_timeout`` rather than blocking forever. It is fully hermetic — no real
subprocess, no network (the drain-to-zero behaviour was additionally verified
manually against the reporter's live repro).
