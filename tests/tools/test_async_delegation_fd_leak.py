"""Regression: the async-delegation ledger must close every SQLite connection.

Sibling of the cron execution-ledger leak (#69567 / PR #69594). The durable
delegation ledger used ``with _connect() as conn:`` where the connection
context manager commits/rolls back but never closes, leaking the db/-wal/-shm
file descriptors on every dispatch, completion, and delivery-claim. These tests
fail if the deterministic ``close()`` is ever removed again.
