"""Regression tests for file-tool path resolution base correctness.

The bug (observed in a worktree dev session, May 2026): when the resolution
base for a relative path is itself RELATIVE — e.g. ``TERMINAL_CWD="."`` from a
stale config — ``_resolve_path_for_task`` resolved the path against the agent's
PROCESS cwd instead of the intended workspace. In a git-worktree session this
silently routed ``patch``/``write_file`` edits into the *main* checkout: the
write landed, self-verified, and reported success — against the wrong file.
The agent then grepped the worktree, saw nothing, and concluded the patch tool
had silently no-op'd. It hadn't; it wrote to the wrong place.

Core invariant these tests pin:
  The resolution base for a relative path MUST always be absolute. A relative
  ``TERMINAL_CWD`` (``.``, ``./sub``, ``..``) must be anchored deterministically,
  never left to resolve against whatever the process cwd happens to be.
