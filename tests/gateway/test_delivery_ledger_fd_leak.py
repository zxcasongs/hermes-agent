"""Regression: the gateway delivery ledger must close every SQLite connection.

Sibling of the cron execution-ledger leak (#69567 / PR #69594). The ledger used
``with _connect() as conn:`` where ``sqlite3.Connection.__exit__`` commits or
rolls back but never closes, leaking the db/-wal/-shm file descriptors on every
call until a long-running gateway exhausts ``RLIMIT_NOFILE``. ``record_obligation``
runs on every outbound final response, so this is the highest-frequency leaker of
the set. These tests fail if the deterministic ``close()`` is ever removed again.
