"""Regression: every platform adapter's ``connect()`` must accept the
``is_reconnect`` keyword-only argument.

The gateway reconnect watcher forwards ``is_reconnect=True`` to every
adapter on every retry (see ``GatewayRunner._call_adapter_connect`` in
``gateway/run.py``). An adapter whose ``connect()`` signature omits
``is_reconnect`` blows up on the first reconnect attempt with::

    TypeError: <Foo>Adapter.connect() got an unexpected
               keyword argument 'is_reconnect'

…and never recovers, leaving that platform silently disconnected until
the operator manually restarts the gateway. This exact bug shipped for
``QQAdapter`` and was only discovered after messages stopped flowing on
the QQ channel for hours.

To prevent this class of bug from regressing, we statically parse every
``adapter.py`` under ``gateway/platforms/`` and ``plugins/platforms/``
and assert that its ``connect()`` method accepts an ``is_reconnect``
keyword. Doing this via AST (rather than importing) avoids pulling every
platform's optional third-party SDK (aiohttp, slack_sdk, telegram,
matrix-nio, etc.) into the test environment.
