"""Regression test for the #54878 x #54947 interaction.

Bug
---
The #54878 self-heal (``SessionStore.get_or_create_session``) detects a
routing key pointing at a session that state.db already marked ended, drops
the stale ``sessions.json`` entry, and recovers/recreates a fresh session_id
under the SAME session_key.

The #54947 fix (``gateway/run.py`` agent-cache cache-hit guard) treats "cached
agent's snapshot session_id differs from the current session_id, same
session_key" as an intentional ``/resume``/``/branch``-style switch between
two live sibling conversations, and reuses the cached agent unchanged so the
prompt cache isn't busted.

These two fixes compose incorrectly: when the #54878 self-heal just fired,
the cached agent's session_id is not a live sibling conversation — it is the
DEAD session that was just routed away from. #54947's rule reuses it anyway.
The stale agent then runs the turn, and the gateway's post-run "session
split" sync (which fires because ``agent.session_id != session_id``) writes
the routing key straight back onto the dead session_id — undoing the
self-heal. This repeats on every subsequent message until an interrupt (e.g.
``/stop``) happens to race in before that post-run sync, corrupting the
observed session lineage and silently discarding conversation context.

No open upstream issue tracked this specific interaction as of 2026-07-12
(checked: #54878, #54947, #59580, #59597, #61220 all cover adjacent but
distinct edges of the self-heal / agent-cache system).

Fix (this test pins it)
------------------------
Before applying #54947's "different session_id -> reuse freely" rule, check
whether the cached snapshot's session_id is itself ended in state.db
(``SessionStore._is_session_ended_in_db``). If so, treat it as a stale
self-heal artifact — evict and rebuild fresh, exactly like a genuine
cross-process write — instead of reusing it.

This mirrors the production decision block added in
``GatewayRunner._handle_message_with_agent`` (gateway/run.py, "Peek at the
cached entry's snapshot session_id..." / ``_stale_dead_sid_reuse``).
