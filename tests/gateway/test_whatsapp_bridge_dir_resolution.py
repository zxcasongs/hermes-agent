"""Tests for resolve_whatsapp_bridge_dir() — read-only install tree handling.

Regression coverage for #49561: in the Docker image the install tree
(/opt/hermes/scripts/whatsapp-bridge) is read-only, so `npm install` fails
with EACCES. The resolver must detect the read-only install dir and mirror the
bridge source into a writable HERMES_HOME location instead.
