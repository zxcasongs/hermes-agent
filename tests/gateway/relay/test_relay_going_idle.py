"""Phase 5 §5.3 — going-idle / buffered-flip primitive (gateway side).

Exercises the WebSocketRelayTransport's going_idle/ack handshake, the
buffered-inbound ack (a bufferId-carrying inbound is acked after the handler
runs), the NET-NEW reconnect loop (re-dial + re-handshake after an unexpected
close), and the RelayAdapter emitting going_idle from its existing drain
(disconnect) transition. All against a real in-process websockets server.
