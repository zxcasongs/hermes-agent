"""Behavior tests for _clear_conversation_scope — the single conversation-
boundary funnel (#64934 follow-up).

Boundaries (/new, /resume, auto-reset, expiry finalization,
compression-exhausted reset) used to each carry a hand-copied pop-list of the
per-session dicts, and the lists drifted whenever a new dict was added
(#48031, #58403, #10702, #35809 were all "boundary X forgot dict Y" bugs).
The funnel clears every dict registered in _CONVERSATION_SCOPED_STATE plus
the boundary security state, in one call.
