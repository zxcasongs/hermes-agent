"""Tests for #60432: the gateway shutdown drain was structurally blind to
in-flight cron work. Cron jobs run through cron/scheduler.py's own thread
pool, entirely outside ``GatewayRunner._running_agents`` -- the dict every
other active-work check on this class reads. A shutdown (``/update``,
``/restart``, SIGUSR1 -- they all funnel through the same ``stop()``) could
report ``active_at_start=0`` and immediately kill tool subprocesses while a
cron job's terminal command was still running.

These tests cover the gateway side of the fix:
  - _active_cron_job_count() reads cron.scheduler's in-flight job set
  - _drain_active_agents() waits for cron work the same way it already
    waits for chat sessions
  - the final tool-subprocess kill marks any still-in-flight cron job
    interrupted

See tests/cron/test_shutdown_interrupt.py for the cron-side primitives
this relies on (get_running_job_ids, mark_running_jobs_interrupted).
