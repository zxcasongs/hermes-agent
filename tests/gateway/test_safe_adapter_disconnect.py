"""Regression tests: failed-connect path must call adapter.disconnect().

When adapter.connect() returns False or raises, the adapter may have
allocated resources (aiohttp.ClientSession, poll tasks, child
subprocesses) before giving up. Without a defensive disconnect() call
these leak and surface as "Unclosed client session" warnings at
process exit (seen on the 2026-04-18 18:08:16 gateway restart).

The fix: gateway/run.py wraps each adapter connect() with a safety-net
call to _safe_adapter_disconnect() in the failure branches.
