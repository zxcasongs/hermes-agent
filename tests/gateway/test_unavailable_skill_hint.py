"""Tests for gateway.run._check_unavailable_skill.

Regression coverage for the dir-name-vs-frontmatter-name drift bug.
The hint function used to compare the skill's parent-directory name
against the typed command and the disabled list. That silently missed
every skill whose directory name differs from its declared frontmatter
name (~19 skills on a standard install), so users typing a real slug
like ``/stable-diffusion-image-generation`` got a generic "unknown
command" response instead of the intended "disabled — enable with …"
or "not installed — install with …" hint.

These tests pin the fixed behavior:

* Slug is derived from the frontmatter ``name:`` (exactly matching
  :func:`agent.skill_commands.scan_skill_commands`), so the slug differs
  from the directory name when the declared name is multi-word.
* ``disabled`` membership is checked by the declared name, because that
  is what :func:`hermes_cli.skills_config.save_disabled_skills` stores.
