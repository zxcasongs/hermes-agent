"""Regression test for TUI approval-prompt credential redaction (#48456).

Follow-up to #50767, which redacted the chat-platform and SSE/API approval
transports. The TUI JSON-RPC transport is the third egress: three
`register_gateway_notify` callbacks in `tui_gateway/server.py` emit the raw
`approval_data` (with an unredacted `command`) to the TUI client. They now
route through the module-level `_emit_approval_request` helper, which redacts
`payload["command"]` via the shared `gateway.run._redact_approval_command` seam
before emitting.
