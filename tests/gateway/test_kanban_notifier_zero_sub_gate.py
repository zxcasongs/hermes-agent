"""Tests for the kanban notifier zero-subscription early exit.

The notifier used to writable-open EVERY board DB on every tick even when a
board had zero subscriptions — paying schema init/migration on first open,
WAL/-shm sidecar creation, and checkpoint traffic for boards with nothing to
notify. Per-board work is now gated by a read-only subscription probe
(``kanban_db.count_notify_subs``), so boards with zero subscriptions are
never opened writable.

(The companion machine-global ``.notifier.lock`` singleton gate from PR
#63001 was deliberately NOT salvaged: a lock-winning default-profile gateway
cannot deliver a secondary profile's subscriptions in standalone-profile
deployments — profile routing fails closed in
``gateway/authz_mixin.py::_authorization_adapter`` — so the lock could
suppress delivery entirely. The read-only probe captures the per-tick cost
win without that risk.)
