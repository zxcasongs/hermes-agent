"""Tests for the holographic MemoryStore shared-connection registry.

MemoryStore instances pointing at the same database file must share one
process-wide SQLite connection and one re-entrant lock. Multiple providers
coexist in a single process (the main agent plus every delegate_task
subagent); when each instance owned a private connection they raced as
independent WAL writers and intermittently failed with "database is locked".

Covers: connection sharing/refcounting, close() semantics, cross-instance
visibility, concurrent multi-instance writers, and write-lock release after
a failed write.
