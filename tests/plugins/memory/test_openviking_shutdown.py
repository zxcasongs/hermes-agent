"""Tests for OpenViking memory-provider shutdown teardown.

The runtime-autostart waiter is a tracked ``daemon=True`` thread that blocks
on network health probes. If ``shutdown()`` doesn't join it (and the waiter
doesn't bail on the shutdown flag), it can be left alive at interpreter exit,
which crashes CPython with SIGABRT at ``Py_FinalizeEx``. These tests assert
the waiter short-circuits on shutdown and that ``shutdown()`` waits for the
runtime-start thread.
