# The same package is exact-pinned in two hand-maintained places: the
# [project.optional-dependencies] extras in pyproject.toml and the LAZY_DEPS
# allowlist in tools/lazy_deps.py (the lazy-install path deliberately mirrors
# the extras — see the comments on LAZY_DEPS: "match the corresponding extra
# in pyproject.toml ... update both this map AND the corresponding extra").
#
# They have silently drifted more than once: the aiohttp Slack pin (3.13.3 in
# the extras vs 3.13.4 in lazy_deps) and the anthropic pin (0.86.0 vs 0.87.0).
# The version a user ends up with then depends on whether the backend was
# installed eagerly (extra) or lazily (lazy_deps) — and for a CVE bump applied
# to only one side, that divergence is a latent security regression. These two
# tests assert the documented contract: the two sources agree, in lockstep.
