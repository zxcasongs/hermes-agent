    On Windows ``asyncio.run`` defaults to a ProactorEventLoop, but uvicorn's
    socket-serving stack forces a SelectorEventLoop on win32
    (``uvicorn/loops/asyncio.py``). Serving on the proactor loop binds a socket
    that never accepts — the backend prints "Skipping web UI build" and hangs
    forever with the port LISTENING but no TCP handshake (#50641). We fix that
    by routing the serve call through ``uvicorn._compat.asyncio_run`` with
    ``config.get_loop_factory()`` — exactly what ``uvicorn.Server.run`` does.

    This asserts the behavioral contract: on Windows the loop factory the runner
    receives is the one uvicorn's own Config produced, and bare ``asyncio.run``
    is never the serve path when the loop-factory runner exists.
