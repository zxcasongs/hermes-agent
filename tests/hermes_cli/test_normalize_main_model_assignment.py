"""Regression tests for ``_normalize_main_model_assignment`` (POST /api/model/set).

Named custom providers are represented as ``custom:<name>`` slugs everywhere
else in the codebase (``runtime_provider.py``, ``model_switch.py``), but
``_KNOWN_PROVIDER_NAMES`` only lists the bare ``"custom"`` bucket. Before this
fix, persisting a main-slot assignment for a named custom provider (e.g. a
LiteLLM proxy fronting Ollama, registered as ``custom:litellm``) together with
a slash-bearing model id (``ollama/glm-5.2``) was indistinguishable from the
"vendor prefix posing as a provider" analytics-fallback case, and got silently
rewritten to ``provider: openrouter`` in ``config.yaml`` -- reassigning the
provider entirely, not just mangling the model id.

A properly *configured* ``custom:<name>`` provider is now resolved earlier,
via ``resolve_custom_provider`` against ``custom_providers``/``providers`` in
config -- that's the primary, intended path and isn't this module's concern
to re-test. What's tested here is the fallback safety net for when that
resolution comes up empty (typo, config drift, entry removed) -- a
``custom:<name>`` slug must still not be misread as a stray analytics vendor
prefix and reassigned to openrouter, even though it isn't in
``_KNOWN_PROVIDER_NAMES`` either.
