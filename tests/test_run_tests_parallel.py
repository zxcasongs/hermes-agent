"""Verify scripts/run_tests_parallel.py kills test-spawned grandchildren.

Setup
-----
A test in this file spawns a long-lived Python grandchild that writes
its PID + a nonce to a tempfile, then exits without cleaning up.
With the old ``subprocess.run`` runner, that grandchild would orphan
and outlive the test (and the whole runner). With the current Popen +
``start_new_session`` + ``_kill_tree`` runner, the grandchild gets
SIGKILL'd via process-group kill when its file's pytest exits.

The leaker test always passes — its only job is to spawn a grandchild
and walk away. The verifier runs the runner over the leaker file in a
subprocess, then waits for the grandchild PID to disappear from the
kernel's process table.

POSIX-only: Windows has its own grandchild lifecycle (no shared session,
``taskkill /F /T`` semantics). Marked accordingly.
