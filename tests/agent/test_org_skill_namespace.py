"""M2 org-skill namespace: token-gated resolution, provenance, collisions.

Covers the design agreed 2026-07-23 (bare-name first-class org skills):
 1. TOKEN-GATED discovery — only the `.active_org`-marked mirror resolves;
    stale mirrors and marker-less trees never load.
 2. Fail-loud collisions — a personal/org name clash lists BOTH sides flagged;
    skill_view's existing multi-candidate guard refuses the bare name.
 3. Load-time provenance header — org skill content announces org + author.
 4. Org mirrors are read-only (skill_manage guards) and curation-exempt.
