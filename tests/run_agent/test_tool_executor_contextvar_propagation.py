"""Regression guard for PR #16660 (salvaged as PR #18027): ContextVar
propagation into concurrent tool worker threads.

Background
----------
Gateway adapters (Slack, Telegram, Discord, ...) set
``tools.approval._approval_session_key`` as a ContextVar before calling
``agent.run_conversation`` so that dangerous-command approval prompts route
back to the channel/session that initiated the tool call. When the agent
dispatches multiple tools in parallel, it uses
``concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor.submit(...)`` — and ``submit`` runs
the callable in a *fresh* context, NOT the caller's context. Without an
explicit ``contextvars.copy_context().run(...)`` wrapper, worker threads
observe the ContextVar's default value, fall through to the
``os.environ`` legacy fallback (which the gateway overwrites at each
agent step), and route the approval card to *whichever session stepped
most recently* — not the one that raised the prompt. Confirmed in the
wild on Slack with two concurrent channels: session A's `rm -rf`
approval card was delivered to session B.

The fix (4 LOC in ``run_agent.py``) snapshots the caller's context with
``copy_context()`` and submits ``ctx.run(_run_tool, …)`` instead of
``_run_tool`` directly. Mirrors ``asyncio.to_thread`` semantics.

This suite follows the ``contextvar-run-in-executor-bridge`` skill's
two-test pattern: one end-to-end test proves the fix works at the
call-site level, one documents the Python contract that makes the fix
necessary. If anyone ever reverts the wrapper, the call-site test
fails while the contract test keeps passing — a clear diagnostic
signal for *why* the call-site regressed.

    approval-session routing race in the gateway before #16660.
