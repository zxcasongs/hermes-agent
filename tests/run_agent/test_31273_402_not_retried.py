"""Regression guard for #31273: HTTP 402 (billing exhaustion) must abort
after credential-pool rotation and provider fallback have failed.

Before the fix, ``FailoverReason.billing`` was in the exclusion set that
prevents the loop's ``is_client_error`` branch from firing.  When a user
ran a pay-per-token provider (OpenRouter, etc.) with no credential pool
and no fallback configured, a single 402 cascaded into
``agent.api_max_retries`` paid requests against an exhausted balance.
Real-world impact: ~$40 burned in 48h on a 24/7 gateway routing Telegram
+ Discord traffic.

The fix removes ``FailoverReason.billing`` from the exclusion set.  By
the time control reaches the ``is_client_error`` check:
  * credential-pool rotation has already run (and either ``continue``d
    on rotation, or returned False because the pool is exhausted/absent).
  * the eager-fallback branch for billing has also run (and either
    ``continue``d on fallback activation, or fell through because no
    fallback is configured).
Falling through to the retry-backoff path from here just burns paid
requests with no recovery mechanism left.  Aborting mirrors how 401/403
(also ``should_fallback=True``) already behave once their recovery paths
have failed.
