"""Tool-dispatch helpers — parallelism gating, multimodal envelopes, mutation tracking.

Pure module-level utilities extracted from ``run_agent.py``:

* ``_is_destructive_command`` — terminal-command heuristic used to gate
  parallel batch dispatch.
* ``_should_parallelize_tool_batch`` / ``_extract_parallel_scope_paths`` /
  ``_extract_parallel_scope_path`` / ``_paths_overlap`` — the rules engine
  deciding when a multi-tool batch can run concurrently (V4A patch scope
  uses patch-body file headers, not a decoy ``path=``).
* ``_is_multimodal_tool_result`` / ``_multimodal_text_summary`` /
  ``_append_subdir_hint_to_multimodal`` — envelope helpers for the
  ``{"_multimodal": True, "content": [...], "text_summary": ...}`` dict
  shape returned by tools like ``computer_use``.
* ``_extract_file_mutation_targets`` / ``_extract_landed_file_mutation_paths`` /
  ``_extract_error_preview`` —
  per-turn file-mutation verifier inputs.
* ``_trajectory_normalize_msg`` — strip image blobs from a message for
  trajectory saving.

All helpers are stateless.  ``run_agent`` re-exports each name so existing
``from run_agent import ...`` imports in tests and other modules keep
working unchanged.

    ``kind`` is ``"parallel"`` (a maximal contiguous run of parallel-safe
    calls) or ``"sequential"`` (one or more barrier calls that must run
    in-order on the sequential path).  Segments preserve the model's
    original call order exactly — a later call never crosses an earlier
    barrier — so tool-result ordering and side-effect boundaries are
    identical to fully-sequential execution.  The per-call safety rules
    are the same ones the old all-or-nothing gate applied to the whole
    batch:

    * ``_NEVER_PARALLEL_TOOLS`` (interactive tools) → barrier.
    * Unparseable / non-dict arguments → barrier.
    * Path-scoped tools (``read_file``/``search_files``/``write_file``/
      ``patch``) join a parallel run only when their target path(s) do not
      CONFLICT with a path already reserved in the same run.  Reservations
      carry a reader/writer role: reader↔reader overlap is harmless (two
      reads of the same file commute) and stays parallel; any overlap
      involving a writer closes the run so the conflicting call starts a
      NEW run after the first completes.  ``search_files`` reserves its
      search root (default ``.``) as a reader — a search batched after a
      write into the searched subtree is ordered behind that write instead
      of racing it.  For V4A ``patch(mode="patch")`` the reserved paths are
      the file headers in the patch body, not a possibly-stale ``path=``
      argument.
    * Anything not in ``_PARALLEL_SAFE_TOOLS`` and not an opted-in MCP
      tool → barrier.

    Parallel runs shorter than two calls are demoted to sequential (no
    concurrency win, and the sequential executor owns the richer inline
    dispatch), and adjacent sequential segments are merged.

    against indirect prompt injection from poisoned web pages, GitHub issues,
    and MCP responses — it changes how the model interprets the content rather
    than relying on regex pattern matching catching every payload.

    Wrapping applies to plain string content and to multimodal content
    lists (``[{"type": "text", "text": "..."}, {"type": "image_url", ...}]``):
    each text-type part is wrapped individually using the same rules as plain
    string content (short text passes through unchanged; longer text is
    neutralized and framed). Non-text parts (e.g. image_url) are preserved.
    The outer list itself is rebuilt rather than returned by identity, so
    callers should compare by value, not by ``is``.
