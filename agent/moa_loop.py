    """Trim an advisory request to fit within a reference model's context window.

    Reference models may have a smaller context window than the aggregator or
    the main conversation. Without this trim, a reference whose window is
    exceeded gets a hard HTTP 400 from the provider, which ``_run_reference``'s
    try/except silently converts to a ``[failed: …]`` note — the MoA turn
    silently degrades to fewer references (issue #60345).

    ``messages`` is the FULL request as it will be sent — the advisory system
    prompt already prepended — so the estimate covers everything the provider
    will count. The budget reserves ``reserve_output_tokens`` (the preset's
    ``reference_max_tokens`` when set, else a sane constant) for the model's
    response plus a safety fraction for estimator error.

    Trimming drops the OLDEST conversation frames (right after the system
    prompt) and preserves two invariants of the advisory view, which is
    text-only user/assistant turns (``_reference_messages`` renders tool
    calls/results inline, so there are no tool-result frames to orphan):

      - the system prompt (index 0) is always kept;
      - the first non-system message stays ``user``-first — after each pop,
        any now-leading assistant turns are popped too, so no provider ever
        sees an assistant-first conversation;
      - the trailing user turn (the synthetic judge-the-state marker) and at
        least one preceding turn are always kept, even if still over budget —
        a too-long-but-recent view beats an empty request.

    ``context_length_cache`` is an optional per-turn dict keyed by
    ``(provider, model)`` so one fan-out (and every iteration reusing the
    cache) resolves each model's window at most once instead of re-probing
    metadata sources per-reference-per-iteration. When the window cannot be
    resolved, messages are returned unchanged.

    Like ``delegate_task``'s batch mode, every reference is dispatched at once

    the aggregator. Output order matches ``reference_models`` so the
    ``Reference {idx}`` labelling stays stable. MoA presets that reference
    another MoA preset are skipped here (recursion guard) with a labelled note.

    If ``progress_callback`` is provided it is invoked as each reference
    completes: ``progress_callback(refs_done, refs_total, label)``. The total
    matches ``len(reference_models)`` so listeners can render a status-bar
    progress like ``MOA: 2/3 refs done``. Best-effort — failures are logged
    but never break the fan-out (display must never block a turn).

    Each element is ``(label, text, accounting)`` where accounting is a
    ``_RefAccounting`` object (zeroed for skipped/failed/interrupted
    references).

    When *agent* is given, the fan-out is interruptible: waiting for the
    batch is broken into ``_REFERENCE_POLL_INTERVAL_S``-second polls (instead
    of one blocking ``future.result()`` per reference) so a user interrupt
    mid-turn can abort the wait — mirroring the same interrupt check
    ``agent.tool_executor`` already applies to its own concurrent tool
    batch. This does not add or change any per-reference *timeout* (that is
    ``reference_timeout`` / ``auxiliary.moa_reference.timeout``, resolved
    elsewhere) — it only lets the caller stop waiting early. References
    already in flight cannot be forcibly killed (``call_llm`` is a blocking
    HTTP call with no interrupt hook of its own, same limitation
    tool_executor has for tools without an interrupt check); an interrupted
    reference's own timeout still reaps its thread independently. *agent* is
    optional and defaults to ``None``, preserving the uninterruptible
    blocking behavior for any caller that doesn't pass it.

    A reference gives an INFORMED judgement on the current state, so it must
    see what the agent actually did — its tool calls AND the tool results that
    came back — not just the agent's narration. We therefore preserve the whole
    conversation flow, but flatten it into clean user/assistant *text* turns:

      - system prompt: dropped (8K of Hermes boilerplate, not advisory signal).
      - assistant turns: kept; any ``tool_calls`` are rendered inline as
        ``[called tool: name(args)]`` text lines appended to the turn's text.
      - ``tool``-role results: NOT dropped. Each is folded (head+tail preview,
        see ``_truncate_tool_result``) into the *preceding* assistant turn as a
        ``[tool result: ...]`` block, so the reference sees what came back.

    This emits ZERO ``tool``-role messages and ZERO ``tool_calls`` arrays — only
    plain user/assistant text — so strict providers (Mistral, Fireworks) that
    reject orphan tool messages / unproduced tool_calls don't 400, while the
    reference still has the full picture.

    The view MUST end with a ``user`` turn. Anthropic (and OpenRouter→Anthropic)
    interpret a trailing assistant turn as an assistant *prefill* to continue,
    and no-prefill models (e.g. Claude Opus 4.8) reject it with
    ``400 ... must end with a user message``. Rather than DELETE the agent's
    latest context to satisfy that (which would blind the reference to the
    current state), we APPEND a synthetic user turn asking the reference to
    judge the state above. End-on-user is satisfied and no context is lost.

    The acting aggregator always receives the full, untrimmed transcript; this
    function only shapes the disposable advisory copy.

    The reference text differs on every tool-loop iteration. In an agentic loop
    the most recent ``user`` message is the *original task* sitting near the TOP
    of the context (everything after it is assistant/tool turns), so merging the
    turn-varying reference block into it diverges the prompt prefix early — the
    server's KV cache cannot be reused and the entire conversation re-prefills on
    every step (full prefill each tool call, dominating latency on long contexts).

    Appending at the very end keeps the ``[system][task][tool-history]`` prefix
    stable and cache-reusable (only the new block re-prefills), and gives the
    aggregator the references with recency. Merge into the last message only when
    it is already a trailing ``user`` turn (plain chat — still at the end).

    A trailing user turn's content may be a STRING or a LIST of content parts —
    Anthropic prompt-cache decoration (which runs before the MoA facade)
    converts string content to ``[{"type": "text", ..., "cache_control": ...}]``,
    and multimodal turns are lists natively. Both shapes are merged in place:
    appending a new text part AFTER the cache_control-marked part keeps the
    cached prefix byte-stable (the marker still terminates it) while the
    turn-varying guidance rides outside the cached span. Appending a SEPARATE
    user message here instead would produce two consecutive user turns —
