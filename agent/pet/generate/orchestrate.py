"""Pet generation orchestration — the base-draft → hatch flow.

Two steps, mirroring the UX across every surface:

1. :func:`generate_base_drafts` — a handful of prompt-only "what should this pet
   look like" variants. Cheap; the user picks one (or retries for a fresh set).
2. :func:`hatch_pet` — takes the chosen base and generates one grounded row
   strip per Hermes state, slices each into frames, composes the atlas, validates
   it, and writes the pet into the store.

Splitting it this way bounds cost (4 cheap base calls per round; the ~6 row
calls happen once, on the pet you actually keep) and gives each UI a natural
preview/loading point.
