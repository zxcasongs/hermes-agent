"""Shared auxiliary client router for side tasks.

Provides a single resolution chain so every consumer (context compression,
session search, web extraction, vision analysis, browser vision) picks up
the best available backend without duplicating fallback logic.

Resolution order for text tasks (auto mode):
  1. User's main provider + main model (used regardless of provider type —
     aggregators, direct API-key providers, native Anthropic, Codex, etc.)
  2. OpenRouter  (OPENROUTER_API_KEY)
  3. Nous Portal (~/.hermes/auth.json active provider)
  4. Custom endpoint (config.yaml model.base_url + OPENAI_API_KEY)
  5. Native Anthropic
  6. Direct API-key providers (z.ai/GLM, Kimi/Moonshot, MiniMax, MiniMax-CN)
  7. None

OpenRouter fallback cost guard: ``auxiliary.free_only: true`` restricts the
step-2 fallback to ``:free`` SKUs; ``auxiliary.openrouter_model`` overrides
the default. A one-time WARNING is logged for non-``:free`` models.

Resolution order for vision/multimodal tasks (auto mode):
  1. Selected main provider, if it is one of the supported vision backends below
  2. OpenRouter
  3. Nous Portal
  4. Native Anthropic
  5. Custom endpoint (for local vision models: Qwen-VL, LLaVA, Pixtral, etc.)
  6. None

Codex OAuth (ChatGPT-account auth) is intentionally NOT in either
fallback chain: OpenAI gates this endpoint behind an undocumented,
shifting model allow-list, so "just try Codex with a hardcoded model"
rots on its own.  Codex is used only when the user's main provider *is*
openai-codex (Step 1 above) or when a caller explicitly requests it with
a model (auxiliary.<task>.provider + auxiliary.<task>.model).

Per-task overrides are configured in config.yaml under the ``auxiliary:`` section
(e.g. ``auxiliary.vision.provider``, ``auxiliary.compression.model``).
Default "auto" follows the chains above.

Payment / credit exhaustion fallback:
  When a resolved provider returns HTTP 402 or a credit-related error,
  call_llm() automatically retries with the next available provider in the
  auto-detection chain.  This handles the common case where a user depletes
  their OpenRouter balance but has Codex OAuth or another provider available.

# happened). Entries auto-expire so a topped-up account recovers without
# manual intervention.

# ── Context-window screening for runtime fallback chains (issue #52392) ──
#
# When the runtime auxiliary fallback chain selects a candidate that is
# reachable but has a context window smaller than the compression task
# requires, the call errors out instead of continuing to the next, viable
# candidate. The startup feasibility check in
# ``agent.conversation_compression.check_compression_model_feasibility``
# already filters too-small auxiliary models at startup, but the runtime
# fallback chain (``_try_configured_fallback_chain`` and
# ``_try_main_fallback_chain``) does not apply the same filter, so
# compression can stop at the first alive door even if the room behind it
# is too small.
#
# The helpers below screen each candidate by its effective context window
# before it is returned. ``None`` results from ``get_model_context_length``
# are passed through (we cannot prove a model is too small, so we do not
# block it). This preserves the existing fallback surface for
# unrecognised/custom models while closing the gap on the well-known ones.

    When an ``AsyncOpenAI`` client is garbage-collected while

    Neutering ``__del__`` is safe because:
    - Cached clients are explicitly cleaned via ``_force_close_async_httpx``

# Two effects, both deliberate:
#   1. The configured ``timeout`` becomes an INTER-CHUNK idle timeout instead
#      of a total budget (httpx applies the read timeout per stream read), so
#      a slow-but-generating summary model is never killed mid-generation
#      while tokens are moving — only a genuinely silent connection dies.
#   2. Every arriving chunk ticks the progress hook, letting outer watchdogs
#      (gateway session hygiene) extend their deadlines on liveness instead
#      of guessing with a fixed wall clock.
# A total ceiling still bounds the pathological 1-token-per-idle-window
