"""Automatic context window compression for long conversations.

Self-contained class with its own OpenAI client for summarization.
Uses auxiliary model (cheap/fast) to summarize middle turns while
protecting head and tail context.

Improvements over v2:
  - Structured summary template with Resolved/Pending question tracking
  - Filter-safe summarizer preamble that treats prior turns as source material
  - Historical (reference-only) section headings replace "Next Steps"/"Remaining Work" to avoid reading as active instructions
  - Clear separator when summary merges into tail message
  - Iterative summary updates (preserves info across multiple compactions)
  - Token-budget tail protection instead of fixed message count
  - Tool output pruning before LLM summarization (cheap pre-pass)
  - Scaled summary budget (proportional to compressed content)
  - Richer tool call/result detail in summarizer input

        """Deterministic, no-LLM tool-result prune for the cost-oriented path.

        Runs the Phase-1 prune (``_prune_old_tool_results``) WITHOUT the
        compression summary phase, gated on ``proactive_prune_tokens`` rather
        than the (much higher) full-compression threshold. On large-window
        models ``should_compress()`` (≈50% of the window) rarely fires, so old
        tool outputs otherwise ride in history and are re-sent verbatim on every
        subsequent turn; this reclaims them early with no quality-risky LLM
        summarization.

        Protects the recent tail by message COUNT (``protect_last_n``), never by
        ``tail_token_budget`` — the latter is derived from the 50% compression
        threshold (≈100K tokens on a 1M window) and would protect the entire
        session, pruning nothing.

        ``_prune_old_tool_results`` runs all three deterministic passes:
        (1) dedup byte-identical tool results — keeps the newest full copy and
        back-references older exact duplicates ANYWHERE in the list (including
        the protected tail), so no unique content is ever lost; (2) summarize
        non-tail tool results larger than ``min_prune_chars``; (3) truncate
        oversized tool_call arguments on non-tail assistant messages. Only
        pass (2)'s floor is raised by ``proactive_prune_min_result_chars``;
        passes (1) and (3) keep their own fixed floors. The recent-tail
        protection applies to passes (2) and (3); pass (1) is tail-agnostic by
        design because dedup is lossless.

        PROMPT-CACHE CONTRACT: a committed prune rewrites message bodies the
        provider has already seen, invalidating the cached prefix from the
        earliest rewritten message forward — exactly like a compression
        boundary. To keep that break episodic rather than per-turn, the prune
        only COMMITS when the estimated reclaim meets
        ``proactive_prune_min_reclaim_tokens`` (measured on the actual pruned
        output, not guessed up front). Below the gate the INPUT list object is
        returned unchanged — the standard no-op caller contract (callers gate
        bookkeeping on ``result is not input``).

        Returns ``(messages, 0)`` — the input object — when disabled, below
        the trigger, or when the reclaim gate rejects the commit.

## Goal
Recovered from a deterministic fallback because the LLM context summarizer was unavailable. Continue from the protected recent messages after this summary and use current file/system state for exact details.{previous_summary_note}

## Constraints & Preferences
- This fallback was generated locally without an LLM summary call.
- Secrets and credentials were redacted before preservation.
- The summary may be incomplete; prefer verifying current files, git state, processes, and test results instead of assuming omitted details.

## Completed Actions

        groups together.  If the last user message ends up in the *compressed*

        but ``SUMMARY_PREFIX`` tells the next model to respond only to user
        messages *after* the summary — so the task effectively disappears from
        the active context, causing the agent to stall, repeat completed work,
        or silently drop the user's latest request.

        Fix: if the last user-role message is not already in the tail

        then re-align backward one more time to avoid splitting any

        only case where ``head_end + 1 > last_user_idx``.  That splits the
        turn-pair: the user lands in the compressed region without its
        assistant reply, so the summariser records it as a pending ask and
        the next session re-executes the already-completed task.  When this
        split is unavoidable, push the cut *forward* to ``pair_end`` so the

             ``_FEASIBILITY_SKIP_MIDDLE_FRACTION`` of the threshold after a

             fallback drop recovers the negligible savings instead)
          5. On re-compression, iteratively update the previous summary

        Blank platform-echo user rows trailing the latest actionable user
        turn are removed in the same cheap pre-pass phase as tool-result
        pruning — i.e. BEFORE any summary-abort early return. An aborted
        compression can therefore still hand back a modified list (echoes
        stripped, no turns summarized); this mirrors the long-standing
        Phase-1 pruning behavior, which likewise survives an abort.
