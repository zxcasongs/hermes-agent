"""Per-turn setup for ``run_conversation`` (the turn prologue).

``run_conversation`` opened with ~470 lines of straight-line setup before the
tool-calling loop ever started: stdio guarding, runtime-main wiring, retry-counter
resets, user-message sanitization, todo/nudge-counter hydration, system-prompt
restore-or-build, session-row creation (before compression, whose DB writes
reference the row), preflight context compression, the ``pre_llm_call`` plugin
hook, external-memory prefetch, and crash-resilience persistence (last, so the
user row is written once with its final ``api_content`` sidecar).

All of that is *prologue* — it runs once per turn, has no back-references into the
loop, and produces a fixed set of values the loop then consumes. ``TurnContext``
captures those produced values; ``build_turn_context`` performs the setup work and
returns one. ``run_conversation`` is left to unpack the context and run the loop,
shrinking the orchestrator by the full prologue.

The builder still mutates ``agent`` heavily (counters, thread id, cached prompt,
session DB) exactly as the inline code did — those side effects are the point. The
``TurnContext`` it returns carries only the *locals* the loop reads back.

Behavior is identical to the original inline prologue; this is a pure
move-and-name refactor with no semantic change.
