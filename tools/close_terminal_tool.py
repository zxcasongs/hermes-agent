"""Close a read-only agent terminal tab in the Hermes desktop GUI.

Each ``terminal(background=true)`` process is mirrored as a read-only tab in the
desktop's terminal pane. This tool lets the agent drop a tab it no longer needs
to show — WITHOUT killing the process (use ``process(action='kill')`` for that).
The output keeps buffering and the user can reopen the tab from the status stack.

It routes through the process registry's ``on_close`` sink, which the desktop
gateway wires to emit a ``terminal.close`` event the renderer handles. Like
``read_terminal`` it is gated on ``HERMES_DESKTOP`` so it never appears outside
the GUI.
