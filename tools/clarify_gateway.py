"""Gateway-side clarify primitive (blocking event-based queue).

The ``clarify`` tool needs to ask the user a question and block the agent
thread until they respond.  In CLI mode this is trivial — ``input()`` is
synchronous.  In gateway mode the agent runs on a worker thread while the
event loop handles the user's reply, so we need a thread-safe primitive
that:

  * stores a pending clarify request (with a generated ``clarify_id``),
  * blocks the agent thread on an ``Event``,
  * resolves the wait when the gateway's button-callback or text-intercept
    fires ``resolve_gateway_clarify(clarify_id, response)``,
  * supports timeouts so a user who never responds does NOT hang the agent
    thread forever (which would also pin the gateway's running-agent guard).

State is module-level (same shape as ``tools.approval``) so platform
adapters can call ``resolve_gateway_clarify`` without holding a back-
reference to the ``GatewayRunner`` instance.

Two delivery paths from the adapter:

  1. **Button UI** — adapters override ``send_clarify`` to render inline
     buttons (e.g. Telegram ``InlineKeyboardMarkup``).  The button
     callback resolves with the chosen string.  A final "Other (type
     answer)" button enters text-capture mode for free-form responses.

  2. **Text fallback** — adapters without rich UI render a numbered list.
     The user replies with a number ("2") or with free text; the gateway's
     ``_handle_message`` intercepts the reply and resolves directly.
