"""Dangerous command approval -- detection, prompting, and per-session state.

This module is the single source of truth for the dangerous command system:
- Pattern detection (DANGEROUS_PATTERNS, detect_dangerous_command)
- Per-session approval state (thread-safe, keyed by session_key)
- Approval prompting (CLI interactive + gateway async)
- Smart approval via auxiliary LLM (auto-approve low-risk commands)
- Permanent allowlist persistence (config.yaml)

# floor below yolo: opting into yolo is the user trusting the agent with
# their files and services, not trusting it to wipe the disk or power the
# box off.
#
# Hardline only applies to environments that can actually damage the host
# (local, ssh, container-host cron).  Containerized backends (docker,
# singularity, modal, daytona) already bypass the dangerous-command layer
# because nothing they do can touch the host, so we leave that behavior
# alone.
#
# The list is deliberately tiny — only things with no recovery path:
# filesystem destruction rooted at /, raw block device overwrites, kernel
# shutdown/reboot, and denial-of-service commands that take the host down.
# Recoverable-but-costly operations (git reset --hard, rm -rf /tmp/x,
# chmod -R 777, curl|sh) stay in DANGEROUS_PATTERNS where yolo can pass
# them through — that's what yolo is for.

    """Escalate an arbitrary tool call to the human-approval gate.

    This is the entry point for a plugin ``pre_tool_call`` hook that returns
    ``{"action": "approve", "message": ...}``: instead of the plugin vetoing
    the call (``action: block``) or silently allowing it, it asks the SAME
    human gate that Tier-2 dangerous shell patterns use. The LLM cannot skip
    or bypass this — the tool call is intercepted before execution.

    It reuses the existing approval primitives (session/permanent allowlist,
    ``prompt_dangerous_approval`` for CLI, ``submit_pending`` for the gateway
    callback, ``[o]nce/[s]ession/[a]lways/[d]eny``, timeout fail-closed) so
    behavior is identical to a dangerous-command match — only the trigger
    (a plugin rule on any tool) differs.

    Args:
        tool_name: The tool being gated (e.g. ``"write_file"``, ``"terminal"``).
        reason: Human-facing message from the plugin explaining why approval
            is needed (rendered in the prompt).
        rule_key: Optional stable identifier the plugin can supply to control
            the ``[a]lways`` allowlist grain. When empty, the key is derived
            from ``tool_name`` + a hash of ``reason`` so that DISTINCT reasons
            on the same tool persist independently (answering ``[a]lways`` to
            "write to ~/.ssh" does NOT auto-approve a later "send email" rule
            on the same tool).
        approval_callback: Optional CLI callback for interactive prompts
            (same contract as ``check_dangerous_command``).

    Returns:
        ``{"approved": True, "message": None}`` when allowed, or
        ``{"approved": False, "message": <reason>, ...}`` when denied /
        blocked. Shape matches ``check_dangerous_command`` so callers handle
        both paths identically.

    Non-interactive contexts: cron jobs honor ``approvals.cron_mode`` (parity
    with dangerous commands); any OTHER non-interactive non-gateway context
    (a bare script with no ``HERMES_INTERACTIVE``) fails CLOSED — a plugin-
    flagged action never runs ungated without a human.
