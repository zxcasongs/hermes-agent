"""Dangerous command approval -- detection, prompting, and per-session state.

This module is the single source of truth for the dangerous command system:
- Pattern detection (DANGEROUS_PATTERNS, detect_dangerous_command)
- Per-session approval state (thread-safe, keyed by session_key)
- Approval prompting (CLI interactive + gateway async)
- Smart approval via auxiliary LLM (auto-approve low-risk commands)
- Permanent allowlist persistence (config.yaml)

# of --yolo, /yolo, approvals.mode=off, or cron approve mode.  This is a
# floor below yolo: opting into yolo is the user trusting the agent with
# their files and services, not trusting it to wipe the disk or power the
# box off.
#
# Hardline only applies to environments that can actually damage the host
# (local, ssh, container-host cron).  Containerized backends (docker,
# singularity, modal, daytona) already bypass the dangerous-command layer
# because nothing they do can touch the host, so we leave that behavior
# alone.
#
# The list is deliberately tiny — only things with no recovery path:
# filesystem destruction rooted at /, raw block device overwrites, kernel
# shutdown/reboot, and denial-of-service commands that take the host down.
# Recoverable-but-costly operations (git reset --hard, rm -rf /tmp/x,
# chmod -R 777, curl|sh) stay in DANGEROUS_PATTERNS where yolo can pass
# them through — that's what yolo is for.

# group can't consume `"`) and the trailing `(\s|$)` terminator, letting
# `rm -rf "/"` slip past the unconditional floor entirely.
#
# Accept the path either fully wrapped in a matching quote pair OR bare with

    escalations). Extracting it keeps the fail-closed / cron / gateway /
    persist policy in ONE place so the two entry points can never drift.

    Ordering mirrors the historical ``check_dangerous_command`` tail:
    yolo bypass → session-cache short-circuit → interactive/gateway/cron
    branch → prompt → ``deny/session/always`` persistence. The caller is
    responsible for the checks that are specific to its input shape
    (hardline detection, command-string permanent allowlist, dangerous-
    pattern detection) BEFORE calling this gate.

    Args:
        pattern_key: Allowlist/session key this decision is stored under.
        description: Human-facing reason shown in the prompt.
        display_target: The command string or synthetic tool label shown
            to the user (redacted by ``prompt_dangerous_approval``).

            per-thread callback registered via

            under ``cron_mode: deny``.
        autoapprove_log_prefix: Log line prefix for the non-interactive
            auto-approve warning (identifies command vs plugin origin).
        fail_closed_when_no_human: When True, a non-interactive non-gateway
            context that is NOT a cron session (e.g. a bare script with
            HERMES_INTERACTIVE unset) BLOCKS instead of auto-approving. The
            dangerous-command path keeps its historical fail-open default
            (False); the plugin-escalation path opts in to fail-closed so a

    This is the entry point for a plugin ``pre_tool_call`` hook that returns

    the call (``action: block``) or silently allowing it, it asks the SAME
    human gate that Tier-2 dangerous shell patterns use. The LLM cannot skip
    or bypass this — the tool call is intercepted before execution.

    It reuses the existing approval primitives (session/permanent allowlist,
    ``prompt_dangerous_approval`` for CLI, ``submit_pending`` for the gateway
    callback, ``[o]nce/[s]ession/[a]lways/[d]eny``, timeout fail-closed) so
    behavior is identical to a dangerous-command match — only the trigger

        tool_name: The tool being gated (e.g. ``"write_file"``, ``"terminal"``).
        reason: Human-facing message from the plugin explaining why approval
            is needed (rendered in the prompt).

            the ``[a]lways`` allowlist grain. When empty, the key is derived

            "write to ~/.ssh" does NOT auto-approve a later "send email" rule
            on the same tool).
        approval_callback: Optional CLI callback for interactive prompts

        ``{"approved": True, "message": None}`` when allowed, or

        blocked. Shape matches ``check_dangerous_command`` so callers handle
        both paths identically.
