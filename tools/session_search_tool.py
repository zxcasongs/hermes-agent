"""
Session Search Tool - Long-Term Conversation Recall

Single-shape tool with three calling modes (inferred from args, no explicit
mode parameter):

  1. DISCOVERY — pass ``query``. Runs FTS5, dedupes hits by session lineage,
     returns top N sessions each with: snippet, ±5 message window around the
     match, plus bookend_start (first 3 user+assistant msgs of session) and
     bookend_end (last 3). Zero LLM cost.

  2. SCROLL — pass ``session_id`` + ``around_message_id``. Returns a window
     of ±window messages centered on the anchor, no FTS5, no bookends. To
     scroll forward / backward, re-anchor on the last / first message id of
     the returned window.

  3. BROWSE — no args. Returns recent sessions chronologically (titles,
     previews, timestamps).

All three modes operate on the SQLite session DB via the FTS5 index and
the get_anchored_view / get_messages_around primitives in hermes_state.
No LLM calls anywhere — every shape returns actual messages from the DB.

History: PR #20238 (JabberELF) seeded a fast/summary dual-mode split; the
toolkit expansion in PR #26419 (yoniebans) added the anchored drill-down,
bookends, and sort. This module merges all of that into a single calling
shape with no mode parameter, no summary LLM path, and explicit scroll
support.

        "and why before falling back to session history. Do not conclude 'not found' "
        "or 'no prior correspondence' from session_search alone when a direct source "
        "was provided.\n\n"
        "FOUR CALLING SHAPES\n\n"
        "  1) DISCOVERY — pass `query`:\n"
        "     session_search(query=\"auth refactor\", limit=3)\n"
        "     Runs FTS5, dedupes hits by session lineage, returns the top N sessions. "
        "Each result carries:\n"
        "       - session_id, title, when, source\n"
        "       - snippet: FTS5-highlighted match excerpt\n"
        "       - bookend_start: first 3 user+assistant messages of the session "
        "(the goal / kickoff)\n"
        "       - messages: ±5 messages around the FTS5 match, with the anchor message "
        "flagged (the hit in context)\n"
        "       - bookend_end: last 3 user+assistant messages of the session "
        "(the resolution / decisions)\n"
        "       - match_message_id, messages_before, messages_after\n"
        "     Bookends + window together let you reconstruct goal → match → resolution "
        "without paying for the whole transcript.\n\n"
        "  2) SCROLL — pass `session_id` + `around_message_id`:\n"
        "     session_search(session_id=\"...\", around_message_id=12345, window=10)\n"
        "     Returns a window of ±`window` messages centered on the anchor. No FTS5, "
        "no bookends — just the slice. Use after a discovery call when you need more "
        "context than the ±5 default window.\n"
        "       - To scroll FORWARD: pass messages[-1].id back as around_message_id.\n"
        "       - To scroll BACKWARD: pass messages[0].id back as around_message_id.\n"
        "       - The boundary message appears in both windows — orientation marker.\n"
        "       - When messages_before or messages_after is < window, you're at the "
        "start or end of the session.\n\n"
        "  3) READ — pass `session_id` only (no around_message_id):\n"
        "     session_search(session_id=\"...\", profile=\"work\")\n"
        "     Dumps the whole session by id (first 20 + last 10 messages when "
        "large). This is how you resolve an `@session:<profile>/<id>` link the "
        "user dropped into the chat: split the value on `/` into profile + id "
        "and call session_search(session_id=id, profile=profile).\n\n"
        "  4) BROWSE — no args:\n"
        "     session_search()\n"
        "     Returns recent sessions chronologically: titles, previews, timestamps. "
        "Use when the user asks \"what was I working on\" without naming a topic.\n\n"
        "LINKING THE USER TO A SESSION\n\n"
        "  When you refer the user to a session, write its `link` value inline in "
        "your reply — every result carries one, e.g. "
        "`@session:default/20260722_204335_d62c16`. Copy it verbatim; do not "
        "reformat it as a markdown link or wrap it in backticks. Hermes renders "
        "it as a link showing the session's title, so the link IS the title: "
        "use it as a noun mid-sentence (\"that's @session:default/... — want me "
        "to pick it up?\"), never alone on its own line, and never alongside the "
        "title, id, or date spelled out — that shows the user the same session "
        "twice.\n\n"
        "FTS5 SYNTAX\n\n"
        "  AND is the default — multi-word queries require all terms. Use OR explicitly "
        "for broader recall (`alpha OR beta OR gamma`), quoted phrases for exact match "
        "(`\"docker networking\"`), boolean (`python NOT java`), or prefix wildcards "
        "(`deploy*`).\n\n"
        "WHEN TO USE\n\n"
        "  Reach for this on questions about Hermes conversation history itself, such "
        "as \"what did we do about X\", \"where did we leave Y\", or \"find the "
        "session where Z\". If the user provided a direct source identifier, inspect "
        "that source first when accessible; session_search can then supply historical "
        "context. The session DB carries what was said when; external tools show "
        "current source/world state."
