"""Per-file parallel test runner.

The minimum-viable replacement for pytest-xdist + a subprocess-isolation
plugin. Discovers test files under ``tests/`` (excluding integration/e2e
unless explicitly requested), then runs one ``python -m pytest <file>``
subprocess per file, with bounded parallelism (default: ``os.cpu_count()``).

Why per-file rather than per-test?
    Per-test spawn overhead (~250ms × 17k tests = 70min CPU minimum)
    swamped the actual work. Per-file spawn (~250ms × ~850 files = ~3.5min)
    fits in the budget while still giving every file a fresh Python
    interpreter — the only isolation boundary that actually matters
    (cross-file module-level state leakage was the original flake source;
    intra-file state is the test author's responsibility).

Why drop xdist entirely?
    xdist's persistent workers accumulate state across files, which is
    exactly the leakage we wanted to fix. xdist also adds complexity
    (loadfile vs loadscope, --max-worker-restart, internal control plane)
    that we don't need when the unit of work is "run pytest on one file".
    A subprocess.Popen pool gated by a semaphore is ~60 lines and does
    the job.

Usage:
    python scripts/run_tests_parallel.py [pytest_args...]

    Common pytest args pass through to each per-file pytest invocation
    (e.g. ``-q``, ``-v``, ``-x``, ``--tb=long``, ``-k 'pattern'``, ``--lf``)
    with no special separator — a bare ``-q`` "just works". Anything after
    a literal ``--`` is also passed through, and stacks with bare flags.

Environment:
    HERMES_TEST_WORKERS  Override worker count (default: os.cpu_count())
    HERMES_TEST_PATHS    Override discovery roots (colon-sep, default: 'tests')

Exit code: 0 if every file's pytest exited 0; 1 otherwise.
