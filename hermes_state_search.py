        A positive merge rank tells SQLite to stop after approximately that
        many output pages, so each command holds the write lock for
        milliseconds regardless of index size — unlike ``'optimize'``, which
        rewrites the whole index in one transaction (measured 9-18 s per
        index on a 10 GB production DB, long enough to exhaust a competing
        writer's entire lock-retry patience).

        Protocol (SQLite FTS5 §6.8-6.9):

        - ``usermerge`` is lowered to its minimum of 2 (persisted in the
          ``%_config`` shadow table, applied once per instance) so a
          positive merge acts on ANY level holding >= 2 segments. With the
          default of 4, levels below that threshold are never merged by a
          positive-rank command and a fragmented index cannot converge.
        - Up to *max_commands* merge commands run per index, stopping early
          on the documented no-progress signal: the delta in
          ``total_changes`` is < 2 (the command's own INSERT accounts
          for 1 change; >= 2 means real merge work happened).

        Each command is its own implicit transaction (the connection runs
        with ``isolation_level=None``), so the SQLite write lock is released
        between commands and competing processes can interleave writes
        mid-pass. Missing tables are valid schema variants (FTS variants are
        optional, and ``optimize_fts_storage`` legitimately drops + backfills
        these tables while writers keep running) and are skipped, mirroring
        ``optimize_fts``. Other SQLite errors propagate to the caller.

        Returns the number of merge commands executed.
