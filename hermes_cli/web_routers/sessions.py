"""Session dashboard routes (extracted verbatim from web_server.py).

Three routers because the original registration points are far apart and
global route order matters: ``list_router`` (GET /api/sessions) was registered
before the profiles ``sessions_router`` include, ``search_router``
(GET /api/sessions/search) right after it, and ``manage_router`` (the
mutation/detail endpoints) thousands of lines later - each is mounted at its
original registration point so the app's route table is byte-identical.

Handler bodies are byte-identical; web_server-owned helpers are reached via
the late-binding seam in :mod:`hermes_cli.web_deps` so tests that
``monkeypatch.setattr(web_server, "_helper", ...)`` keep working.

    Backs the dashboard's bulk-select-and-delete flow on the sessions
    page. POST (not DELETE) because most HTTP clients refuse to send a
    request body on DELETE and a body is the natural shape for a list
    of IDs — Starlette accepts both, but POSTing a list keeps proxies,
    curl, and the browser ``fetch`` API consistent.

    Per-row contract matches :meth:`SessionDB.delete_sessions`:

    * Unknown IDs are silently skipped (the response ``deleted`` count
      reflects what really happened, not the input length). This is
      deliberate — UI selection state can race against another tab's
      delete, and we'd rather succeed-on-the-rest than fail-the-whole-
      batch.
    * Children of every deleted parent are orphaned, not cascade-
      deleted.
    * Active and archived sessions ARE deleted when explicitly
      selected — unlike ``DELETE /api/sessions/empty``, the user
      hand-picked the rows so we trust the selection.
    * Like the other session-delete endpoints, this does NOT pass a
      ``sessions_dir`` through; on-disk transcript / request-dump
      cleanup runs at the CLI/agent layer on the next prune pass.

    The response carries the actual deleted count, so the dashboard
    can surface it in a toast. The IDs that were removed are not
    echoed back because the client already knows what it asked to
    delete (unknown IDs are silently skipped — see contract above)
    and can prune its in-memory list directly from the request.
