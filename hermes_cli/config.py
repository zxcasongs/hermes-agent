Configuration management for Hermes Agent.

Config files are stored in ~/.hermes/ for easy access:
- ~/.hermes/config.yaml  - All settings (model, toolsets, terminal, etc.)
- ~/.hermes/.env         - API keys and secrets

This module provides:
- hermes config          - Show current configuration
- hermes config edit     - Open config in editor
- hermes config get      - Print a resolved configuration value
- hermes config set      - Set a specific value
- hermes config unset    - Remove a user configuration value
- hermes config wizard   - Re-run setup wizard

# * ``NODE_OPTIONS`` / ``NODE_PATH`` — Node interpreter; affects npm,

# * ``PATH`` — too broad to allow. The dashboard never needs to rewrite
#   the operator's PATH; if a tool can't be found, the fix is to add an
#   absolute path in the integration config, not to mutate PATH globally.
# * ``GIT_SSH_COMMAND`` / ``GIT_EXEC_PATH`` — git rewrites that fire
#   on every plugin install / ``hermes update``.
# * ``BROWSER`` / ``EDITOR`` / ``VISUAL`` / ``PAGER`` — commands the
#   shell or CLI invokes implicitly. Wrong values here = RCE on next
#   ``$EDITOR``.
# * ``SHELL`` — what subprocess uses with ``shell=True`` (we try to

# * ``HERMES_HOME`` / ``HERMES_PROFILE`` / ``HERMES_CONFIG`` /

    2. Legacy home-scoped stamp ``$HERMES_HOME/.install_method`` — read for
       backward compatibility, but a ``docker`` value is IGNORED when we are
       not actually running inside a container (see below).
    3. HERMES_MANAGED env / .managed marker (NixOS managed mode)
    4. /nix/store/ path detection -> 'nix' (nix run / nix profile install)
    5. .git directory presence -> 'git'
    6. Fallback -> 'unknown'

    Why the stamp is code-scoped, not home-scoped (issue: shared ``~/.hermes``)
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The install method describes *the binary that is running*, but
    ``$HERMES_HOME`` is a shared DATA directory — the Docker docs deliberately
    bind-mount it (``~/.hermes:/opt/data``) so config/sessions/memory persist
    and can be shared with a host-side Desktop/CLI install. When a
    containerised gateway and a host install share one ``$HERMES_HOME``, a
    home-scoped stamp is a single slot describing two different installs:
    the container stamps ``docker`` on every boot, the host install then reads
    ``docker`` and ``hermes update`` refuses to run ("doesn't apply inside the
    Docker container") even though the host binary is a perfectly updatable
    git/pip install. Scoping the stamp to the install tree gives each install
    its own truthful marker.

    Self-healing for already-poisoned homes: a legacy ``docker`` value in the
    home-scoped stamp is only honoured when we are genuinely in a container.
    On a host install that read a contaminating ``docker`` stamp, we fall
    through to managed/.git detection instead — so existing shared-home
    setups recover without the user touching anything.

    Note: running inside a container is NOT treated as "docker" on its own.
    The supported installs self-identify via the code-scoped stamp:
      - the curl installer (scripts/install.sh, the README/website install
        command) git-clones the repo and stamps ``git`` next to the code;
      - the published ``nousresearch/hermes-agent`` image bakes a ``docker``
        stamp into ``/opt/hermes`` at build time.
    An unsupported manual install dropped into a container (no stamp) falls
    through to the ``.git`` checks and behaves like any off-path install.

# don't grow two slightly-different copies.
#
# Why this matters:
#   - The published image excludes ``.git`` (see .dockerignore), so the
#     git-based update path can never succeed inside the container.
#   - The pre-existing fallback message ("✗ Not a git repository. Please
#     reinstall: curl ... install.sh") is actively misleading inside Docker
#     — that script installs a *new* host-side Hermes, it doesn't update
#     the running container.
#   - The right action is ``docker pull`` + restart the container; this
#     helper spells that out, with notes on tag pinning and config
#     persistence so users don't get blindsided.
_DOCKER_UPDATE_MESSAGE = """\
✗ ``hermes update`` doesn't apply inside the Docker container.

Hermes Agent runs as a published image (nousresearch/hermes-agent), not a
git checkout — the container has no working tree to pull into.  Update by
pulling a fresh image and restarting your container instead:

  docker pull nousresearch/hermes-agent:latest
  # then restart whatever started the container, e.g.:
  docker compose up -d --force-recreate hermes-agent
  # or, for ad-hoc runs, exit the current container and `docker run` again

Verify the new version after restart:
  docker run --rm nousresearch/hermes-agent:latest --version

Notes:
  • If you pinned a specific tag (e.g. ``:v0.14.0``) the ``:latest`` tag
    won't move your container — pull the newer tag you actually want, or
    switch to ``:latest`` / ``:main`` for rolling updates.  See available
    tags at https://hub.docker.com/r/nousresearch/hermes-agent/tags
  • Your config and session history live under ``$HERMES_HOME`` (``/opt/data``
    in the container, typically bind-mounted from the host) and persist
    across image upgrades — re-pulling doesn't lose any state.
  • Running a fork?  Build your own image with this repo's ``Dockerfile``
    and replace the ``docker pull`` step with your build/push pipeline."""

    THE INVARIANT (single source of truth for the whole migration pipeline):
    a migration may only persist values that DIFFER from the current schema
    default, plus explicit removals/renames of user data. Pure schema defaults
    are never materialised to disk — ``load_config()``'s deep-merge supplies
    them at read time, so writing them adds nothing and actively shadows future
    default changes (see ``save_config``'s docstring). Materialising defaults on
    every version bump is what rewrote hand-curated configs into full
    DEFAULT_CONFIG dumps (the "hermes update / hermes -p blows up my config"
    reports).

    Every migration step MUST route its write through this helper instead of
    calling ``save_config`` directly. It is a thin wrapper over
    ``save_config(config)`` (default-stripping ON, no ``merge_existing``);
    centralising the call makes the invariant impossible to regress one
    migration at a time. Callers must pass the full raw config returned by
    ``read_raw_config()`` after in-place mutations (including key removals);
    deep-merging the on-disk file back in would resurrect keys the migration
    just deleted. Partial-save preservation for unrelated top-level sections
    belongs on ``save_config(..., merge_existing=True)``, not here.

    Some users (or older code) placed ``provider:``, ``base_url:``, or
    ``context_length:`` at the config root instead of inside ``model:``.
    These root-level keys are only used as a fallback when the corresponding
    ``model.*`` key is empty — they never override an existing value.
    After migration the root-level keys are removed so they can't cause
    confusion on subsequent loads.

    Also aliases ``api_base`` → ``base_url`` (issue #8919). ``api_base`` is the
    intuitive name OpenAI-SDK / LiteLLM users reach for, and ``hermes config set``
    blindly accepts any dotted key — so ``model.api_base`` got written, confirmed,
    and then silently ignored by the runtime resolver (which reads only
    ``model.base_url``), causing requests to fall back to OpenRouter. We migrate
    the alias to the canonical key (fallback-only — never override an explicit
    ``base_url``) and drop the alias so it can't confuse later loads.

    Finally, canonicalizes the model-id key to ``model.default`` (issue #34500).
    The runtime resolver and ~14 other readers select the chat model via
    ``model.default``; ``model.model`` was already aliased inline at some sites
    but ``model.name`` was not, so a custom-provider config like
    ``model: {name: <id>, provider: <custom>}`` resolved to an empty model and
    the API request went out with ``model=`` (HTTP 400 from OpenAI-compatible
    backends) — while display paths (``hermes status``/``dump``) read ``name``
    and *showed* the model, making the failure silent. Normalizing here (the
    single load/save chokepoint) means every reader, present and future, sees a
    populated ``default`` and the stale alias is migrated out of config.yaml on
    the next save. Precedence: ``default`` > ``model`` > ``name`` (never

      * PRESENCE-SENSITIVE ENV BRIDGES (gateway/send bridges that only
        export a key when the user explicitly set it): a defaults merge
        would make every key "present" and bridge the entire DEFAULT_CONFIG
        into the environment. These sites must still apply
        ``managed_scope.apply_managed_overlay`` + ``_expand_env_vars``
        inline, which they do.

    Semantics (deliberately mirrors the bare ``open()+yaml.safe_load()``
    pattern this replaces, so migrated sites keep their exact failure
    behavior):

      * missing file → ``{}``
      * unparseable YAML / other I/O errors → raises (callers that want
        fail-open already wrap in try/except; callers with last-known-good
        or warn semantics rely on the exception)
      * non-dict YAML root → ``{}``

    ``config_path`` defaults to :func:`get_config_path` (profile-aware).
    Pass an explicit path when the caller resolves its own home (gateway
    ``_hermes_home``, tui profile override, multi-profile probes).
