"""Hermes update pipeline — extracted from ``hermes_cli/main.py``.

Mechanical move (main.py decomposition): ``_cmd_update_impl``, ``_cmd_update_check``
and every module-level helper used only by the update path, plus the update-only
constants they read. Function bodies are lifted verbatim; the only mechanical
change is that references to helpers/constants that STAY in ``hermes_cli.main``
(and to moved-but-test-patched siblings) are routed through ``_m()`` — a lazy
``hermes_cli.main`` reference — so existing call sites and test monkeypatches
that target ``hermes_cli.main.<name>`` (``PROJECT_ROOT``, ``_is_windows``,
``_run_pre_update_backup``, ...) keep working unchanged. ``main.py`` re-imports
every public-ish name from here (``# noqa: F401``) so the argparse wiring and
the test-patch surface still resolve on ``hermes_cli.main``.

Three self-contained closures nested inside ``_cmd_update_impl``
(``_print_items``, ``_wait_for_service_active``, ``_service_restart_sec``) were
hoisted to module level; they capture no enclosing state (verified via
``symtable``). ``_restart_one_systemd_gateway_unit``, ``_resolve_manage_cmd``
and ``_on_unit_timeout`` DO capture enclosing locals and stay nested,
byte-identical.

Imports are one-way: ``hermes_cli.main`` imports this module, never the reverse
at import time (``_m()`` resolves lazily at call time, when main.py is fully
loaded, so there is no import cycle).

    ``acp`` subcommand, which makes it correct for every install layout
    (venv wrapper, FHS symlink, pipx/pip console script) without having to
    reconstruct interpreter/entrypoint paths.

    breaks ``git checkout`` on update with "Your local changes would be

                Read-only systemctl calls (``is-active``, ``show``,
                ``list-units``) work unprivileged, but manage-units verbs
                (``reset-failed``, ``start``, ``restart``) on a *system*
                service trigger a polkit ``org.freedesktop.systemd1.manage-units``
                authentication prompt when run as a non-root user.  That
                interactive prompt runs inside our captured subprocess with a
                10-15s timeout — the user sees the prompt flash and "exit
                directly" before they can answer, and the resulting
                TimeoutExpired used to be swallowed silently.

                Strategy: if root, plain systemctl.  If not root, try
                non-interactive sudo (``sudo -n``) — first a blanket probe,
                then a targeted ``systemctl reset-failed`` probe so a
                least-privilege sudoers entry scoped to
                ``systemctl ... hermes-gateway*`` also qualifies
                (``reset-failed`` is an idempotent no-op we run before every
                privileged restart anyway).  If neither works, return None —
                the caller must SKIP the restart (without draining the
                gateway first!) and tell the user how to restart manually.
                ``--no-ask-password`` guarantees polkit can never hang a
                captured subprocess on this path.
