"""Billing and subscription handlers for the interactive CLI (god-file decomposition).

This module hosts the Nous billing/subscription methods lifted out of
``cli.py``'s ``HermesCLI`` class. ``HermesCLI`` inherits
``CLIBillingMixin`` so every ``self.<handler>`` call resolves unchanged
via the MRO — behavior-neutral apart from focused billing fixes.

Import discipline mirrors ``hermes_cli.cli_commands_mixin``:
  * Neutral, non-cyclic dependencies are imported at module top level below.
  * cli.py-internal symbols (the ``_cprint``/``_b``/``_d`` helpers and
    display constants) are imported LAZILY inside each method via
    ``from cli import ...``. The mixin never imports ``cli`` at module load
    time, avoiding the cycle created when ``cli.py`` imports this mixin.
