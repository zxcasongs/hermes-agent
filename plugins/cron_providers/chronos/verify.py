"""Inbound cron-fire token verification for Chronos (Phase 4E.1).

When NAS relays an external scheduler fire to the agent, it POSTs
``/api/cron/fire`` with a short-lived NAS-minted JWT. This module verifies that
JWT before any job runs — the security boundary for remotely-triggered job
execution.

We verify a NAS-minted JWT (the trust path the agent already has) rather than
let an external scheduler call the agent directly: the scheduler signs with
NAS's keys, which the agent doesn't (and shouldn't) hold. See the plan's DQ-4.

The verifier is pluggable (``get_fire_verifier``) so the escape-hatch mode
(direct per-job cron-key) can swap in later with no handler change.

Crypto is delegated to PyJWT (already a declared dependency) — we do NOT
hand-roll JWT verification.

# WHY THIS EXISTS: a PyJWKClient caches the fetched JWKS (signing keys) on the
# INSTANCE. Constructing a fresh client per fire therefore threw that cache
# away and forced a synchronous JWKS HTTP GET to the portal on EVERY fire. Under
# a burst of concurrent fires (an instance with several cron jobs firing in the
# same window) that fanned out into N simultaneous JWKS fetches, which the
# portal rate-limited (HTTP 403) — verification then failed and the agent
# answered 401. When a fetch was merely slow rather than rate-limited, it blocked
# the event loop long enough that the fire webhook could not return its 202
# before the relay's 30s timeout (observed in prod as relay 504s concentrated on
# high-job-count instances). Reusing one client per URL keeps the signing keys
# cached (NAS keys rotate rarely), so the steady state is zero JWKS fetches per
# fire. See docs/chronos-managed-cron-contract.md and the betterstack triage.
