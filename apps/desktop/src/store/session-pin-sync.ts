/**
 * Reconcile the sidebar's pins with the backend "keep" flag, both directions.
 *
 * Pins drive the sidebar UI out of `$pinnedSessionIds` (localStorage), but the
 * durable record is `sessions.pinned` in each profile's state.db. Two things
 * depend on the backend copy: the `sessions.auto_archive` sweep runs
 * server-side and would otherwise hide a pinned chat, and a second Desktop app
 * pointed at the same gateway has its own, separate localStorage.
 *
 * Push: PATCH `pinned` whenever the local set changes, and re-assert the whole
 * set at boot — which transparently migrates pre-existing pins with no user
 * action.
 *
 * Pull: session rows now carry `pinned`, and the list endpoints back-fill
 * pinned conversations past their LIMIT, so a row's absence from a page no
 * longer says anything about its pin state. That makes the server row
 * authoritative: adopt pins this app hasn't seen, and drop local pins the
 * server says are gone. Only rows actually present in the payload are
 * consulted, so a backend predating the flag (`pinned === undefined`) leaves
 * the local set untouched.
