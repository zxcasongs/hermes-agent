// carry it down, Backspace has to drop it whole, and a chip landing on it has
// to consume it.

// `@` triggers stop at the first whitespace — `@file:path` and `@diff` are
// single tokens, and a path is part of that token: `@./src/`, `@~/Desktop/`,
// and `@file:src/foo` all have to keep the popover live while the user walks
// into subdirectories. Excluding `/` from the query class would end the token
// at the first separator, which is exactly the "can't browse into a folder"
// bug. Restricting the slash command name to `[a-zA-Z][\w-]*` avoids
// matching file paths like `src/foo/bar`.
//
// `/` triggers fire in two shapes, because a slash means two different things
// depending on where it sits:
//
//  - At position 0 it's a COMMAND invocation the app executes (SLASH_COMMAND_RE
//    is `^`-anchored, and so is the backend's). The popover stays live past the
//    command name so arg completion works (`/personality alic` → `alice`).
//  - After whitespace it's an inline REFERENCE the user is dropping into prose
//    ("clean this up with /clean"). The text submits as an ordinary message, so
//    there are no args to complete — the trigger is a single token that ends at
//    the next space, exactly like `@`.
//
// Only the FIRST slash can be an invocation, so the inline shape is tested
// first: the command regex's argument tail (`(?:\s+\S*)*`) happily swallows a
// later `/skill` as if it were an argument, which killed completion for every
// slash after a leading command (`/work /cle` → nothing).
//
// The inline shape is what makes skills reachable anywhere in a prompt. Both
// shapes need the trailing `$`: detection runs against the text BEFORE the
// caret, so the match must end where the user is typing.
//
// U+FFFC is the placeholder textBeforeCaret emits for a committed chip. A chip
// edge is a token boundary just like whitespace (upstream assistant-ui's
// Lexical DirectivePlugin gets the same semantics from node boundaries), so
// `@` or `/` typed immediately after a pill still opens the popover.
