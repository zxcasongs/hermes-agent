 * mounts its ChatBar under its own scope, so N composers coexist: separate
 * attachment chips, separate focus/insert routing, separate Esc semantics.
 *
 * Draft TEXT needs no scoping — it lives in each ChatBar's contentEditable +
 * draftRef and stashes per session key (`stashSessionDraft`), which already
 * differs per surface.
