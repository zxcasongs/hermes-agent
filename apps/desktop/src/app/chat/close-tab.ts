/**
 * Close the MAIN tab. The workspace pane itself can't leave the tree, so
 * "closing" it means emptying it, and what fills the hole depends on what's
 * stacked beside it:
 *
 *  - session tabs stacked with it → the next one shifts INTO main (drop its
 *    tile, load it as the primary — the session stays alive, no busy prompt),
 *  - nothing stacked → main drops to a fresh "New session" draft.
 *
 * The second half is what makes the gesture honest when main is the ONLY tab:
 * ⌘W / ⌘-click / middle-click used to be a dead key there, since the only
 * available answer was "remove the pane", which this app never does.
 *
 * Returns false when there is nothing to close — a blank draft (already the
 * post-close state) or a full-page view (skills / artifacts, which isn't a
 * chat and owns no tab). ⌘W then stays a no-op; it never closes the window.
 *
 * `loadSessionIntoWorkspace` carries the app's route-based "load this session
 * into main"; omitting it disables the promotion half.
