/**
 * Block splitting for the streaming markdown pipeline, without re-lexing the
 * whole message on every token flush.
 *
 * `parseMarkdownIntoBlocks` is a full `marked` lex of the entire text —
 * measured 3.4–9.6ms per call at 64–192KB. During streaming every flush is a
 * new string, so the stock splitter pays that O(full-text) cost ~30×/s on
 * long replies. Two caches remove it:
 *
 * 1. Exact-string cache — the same text always yields the SAME ARRAY. This is
 *    identity, not just cost: `parseMarkdownIntoBlocks` builds a fresh array
 *    every call, and Streamdown mirrors the block list into `useState`, so a
 *    new array identity for unchanged text makes every Streamdown re-render
 *    itself and re-render every Block under it. Short messages used to skip
 *    the cache on the theory that re-lexing them was cheap — the lex is, but
 *    the churn it caused was not (measured: ~105 self-renders of Streamdown
 *    across five idle tiles in six seconds, cascading into 800 Block renders
 *    with nothing streaming). Every length is cached now.
 * 2. Streaming-append cache — when the new text starts with a recently parsed
 *    text (the token-append case), the previous parse's blocks are reused up
 *    to a settled boundary and only the suffix is lexed. The boundary drops
 *    the previous parse's trailing whitespace-only blocks AND its last content
 *    block, because appended text can retroactively change how that last
 *    block parses (open fence, list/table continuation, setext underline, a
 *    lazy blockquote line). Blocks before it are separated by settled blank
 *    lines and cannot be affected. Cross-block reference links can't regress:
 *    Streamdown renders each block as an independent markdown document
 *    already. Verified property: `blocks.join('') === text`, and incremental
 *    output is asserted byte-identical to a full lex in tests across fences,
 *    lists, tables, setext headings, blockquotes, and HTML blocks.
 *
 * Any doubt — no prefix match, reconstruction mismatch — falls back to the
 * full lex, i.e. exactly the previous behavior.
