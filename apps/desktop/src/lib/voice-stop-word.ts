// Spoken stop-word detection for the voice conversation loop.
//
// When someone is in a hands-free "Hey Hermes" voice chat, the natural way to
// end it is to SAY "stop" — not reach for the mouse. Without this, a spoken
// "stop" is just transcribed and sent to the agent as a normal turn, so the
// conversation never ends (the reported bug). This matcher recognises a short
// utterance whose entire content is a stop command and ends the conversation
// instead of submitting it.
//
// Deliberately conservative: it only fires when the WHOLE utterance is a stop
// phrase (optionally addressed to Hermes), so a real turn that merely contains
// the word "stop" — e.g. "stop the docker container" or "how do I stop a
// running process" — is never swallowed.

// Canonical stop commands. Kept short and unambiguous; each must be the entire
// spoken utterance to match.
