// Stream-aware background throttling for chat windows.
//
// Chat windows must paint the live transcript while blurred, occluded, or
// minimized — but a static `backgroundThrottling: false` in webPreferences
// costs far more than that feature needs: it pins the renderer's
// `document.visibilityState` to 'visible' for the life of the window, which
// turns every visibility-gated poll and clock tick in the renderer into an
// always-on timer. An idle, hidden Hermes burned ~20% CPU forever.
//
// So throttling is a runtime dial instead: the renderers already report
// "which chats are mid-turn" for the quit guard (`hermes:active-work`), and
// this controller rides the merged edge of those reports. Any turn in flight →
// every registered chat window gets `setBackgroundThrottling(false)`, exactly
// the streaming behavior the static flag used to provide. All turns done →
// after a short trailing delay (so tail flushes land at full cadence) Chromium's
// default throttling returns and hidden windows go quiet.
//
// Pure and Electron-free (timers + the WebContents surface are injected) so it
// can be unit-tested, mirroring session-windows.ts.

/** How long after the last turn ends before throttling is restored. Covers the
 * stream queue's final coalesced flush and the settle writes that trail a
