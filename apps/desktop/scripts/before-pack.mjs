/**
 * before-pack.mjs — electron-builder beforePack hook.
 *
 * Two responsibilities:
 *
 * 1. Removes any stale unpacked app directory (`appOutDir`) before
 *    electron-builder stages the Electron binaries into it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * electron-builder's final packaging step copies the stock `electron`
 * binary into `release/<platform>-unpacked/` and then renames it to the
 * product name (`Hermes`). If a PREVIOUS `npm run pack` was interrupted
 * (Ctrl-C, OOM kill, crash, full disk) the unpacked directory is left in a
 * corrupted partial state: it keeps the already-renamed `LICENSE.electron.txt`
 * and the Chromium payload (.pak/.so/icudtl.dat/chrome-sandbox) but is MISSING
 * the `electron` binary itself.
 *
 * On the next run, electron-builder sees the destination directory already
 * populated, skips re-copying the binary it thinks is present, then tries to
 * rename a `electron` file that no longer exists. The build dies with:
 *
 *   ENOENT: no such file or directory, rename
 *   '.../release/linux-unpacked/electron' -> '.../release/linux-unpacked/Hermes'
 *
 * This is a hard failure with no obvious cause for the user — `hermes desktop`
 * just prints "Desktop GUI build failed" and the only fix is to manually
 * `rm -rf` the release directory, which a normal user has no way to know.
 *
 * The packaging step is not idempotent across an interrupted run, so we make
 * it idempotent ourselves: wipe the target unpacked directory up front so
 * electron-builder always stages into a clean tree. This is safe — the
 * directory is a pure build artifact that electron-builder fully recreates
 * on every pack; nothing else depends on its prior contents.
 *
 * Cross-platform: the same partial-state trap exists on macOS
 * (the mac-unpacked Hermes.app bundle) and Windows (win-unpacked), so we
 * clean whatever `appOutDir` electron-builder hands us regardless of platform.
 *
 * Best-effort: a cleanup failure must never mask the real build. We log and
 * resolve rather than throw — worst case electron-builder hits the original
 * ENOENT, which is no worse than not having this hook at all.
 *
 * 2. Re-stages node-pty's native files for the ACTUAL target platform/arch
 *    of this pack. `npm run build` already staged node-pty once for the
 *    host machine (see scripts/stage-native-deps.mjs), which is correct for
 *    single-arch builds matching the host. But electron-builder can target
 *    a different arch than the host (cross-build), or pack multiple archs
 *    from one `npm run build` (e.g. `dist:mac` => x64 + arm64). Only this
 *    hook knows the real per-target arch, via `context.arch` /
 *    `context.electronPlatformName` — so it re-stages on top of whatever
 *    `npm run build` left behind, per target, right before files are read
 *    for packing.
 *
 * electron-builder passes a context with:
 *   - appOutDir:            the unpacked app directory about to be staged
 *   - electronPlatformName: 'win32' | 'darwin' | 'linux'
 *   - arch:                 Arch enum (0=ia32, 1=x64, 2=armv7l, 3=arm64, 4=universal)

 * Windows rollback material (#69179): before wiping the previous unpacked
 * tree, preserve it as `<appOutDir>.bak` — but ONLY when it holds the product
 * exe (i.e. it is a previously-working build, not the corrupted partial state
 * cleanStaleAppOutDir exists to remove). If the fresh pack then produces a
 * Hermes.exe that Windows can't load (truncated PE from a corrupt cached
 * Electron zip, wrong arch), the updater's integrity gate in
 * `hermes desktop --build-only` (hermes_cli/main.py
 * `_ensure_desktop_exe_launchable`) restores this .bak instead of leaving the
 * user with "This app can't run on your computer".
 *
 * Returns true when the tree was preserved (appOutDir no longer exists), false
 * when there was nothing worth preserving (caller falls through to the wipe).
 * A rename failure (AV holding a handle) also returns false — the wipe is the
 * safe fallback and matches pre-#69179 behavior exactly.
