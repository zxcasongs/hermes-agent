# Pets

Hermes can show an animated **pet** — a small mascot sprite that reacts to what
the agent is doing (idle, running a tool, thinking, finishing, failing) across
the **CLI**, **TUI**, and **desktop app**. Pets come from the public
[petdex](https://github.com/crafter-station/petdex) gallery.

Pets are purely cosmetic. They have **no effect on prompt caching, tokens, or
the agent's behavior** — the sprite is a display concern only. The feature is
**off by default** and stays dormant until you install and select a pet.

## How it works

- Pets are installed into your profile's `pets/` directory
  (`<HERMES_HOME>/pets/<slug>/`), so each [profile](../profiles.md) keeps its
  own set.
- Selecting a pet writes `display.pet.slug` and `display.pet.enabled` to
  `config.yaml` — nothing is stored as a secret or env var.
- Each surface watches the activity it already tracks and maps it to one of six
  animation states. The mapping lives in one place so every surface behaves the
  same:

  | Agent activity | Pet state |
  | --- | --- |
  | A tool/turn just failed | `failed` |
  | A plan finished (all todos done) | `jump` (celebrate) |
  | A turn finished cleanly | `wave` |
  | A tool is executing | `run` |
  | The model is thinking/reading | `review` |
  | Turn in flight (unspecified) | `run` |
  | Blocked on you (a clarify/approval prompt is open) | `waiting` (falls back to `idle` on legacy 8-row sheets) |
  | Nothing happening | `idle` |

## Rendering

In the terminal (CLI/TUI), Hermes renders the sprite at full fidelity when your
terminal supports a graphics protocol (**kitty**, **Ghostty**, **WezTerm**,
**iTerm2**, or **sixel**). Otherwise it falls back automatically to a truecolor
Unicode **half-block** rendering. Inside a pipe or redirect (no TTY), terminal
rendering is disabled by design.

The desktop app draws the pet as a floating sprite on a canvas and toggles it
from **Settings → Appearance**.

## Quick start (CLI)

```bash
# Browse the gallery (filter by substring)
hermes pets list
hermes pets list cat

# Install a pet and make it active in one step
hermes pets install boba --select

# Preview / animate it in your terminal (Ctrl+C to stop)
hermes pets show

# Check your setup
hermes pets doctor
```

## `hermes pets` commands

| Goal | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Browse the gallery | `hermes pets list [query] [--limit N]` |
| List installed pets | `hermes pets list --installed` |
| Install a pet | `hermes pets install <slug> [--select] [--force]` |
| Set the active pet | `hermes pets select [slug]` (omit slug for a picker) |
| Resize the pet everywhere | `hermes pets scale <factor>` (e.g. `0.5`, clamped 0.1–3.0) |
| Preview/animate | `hermes pets show [slug] [--state <s>] [--cycle] [--once] [--mode <m>] [--scale <f>]` |
| Disable the pet | `hermes pets off` |
| Remove an installed pet | `hermes pets remove <slug>` |
| Diagnose setup | `hermes pets doctor` |

`hermes pets show` flags:

- `--state` — play a single state (`idle`, `wave`, `run`, `failed`, `review`,
  `jump`).
- `--cycle` — cycle through every state.
- `--once` — play once instead of looping.
- `--mode` — override the render protocol (`kitty`, `iterm`, `sixel`,
  `unicode`, `auto`).
- `--scale` — override the on-screen scale (`0` = use config).

## `/pet` slash command

Inside the CLI and TUI you can manage the pet without leaving the session:

- `/pet` — toggle the pet on/off (adopts the first installed pet if none is
  active).
- `/pet list` — browse the gallery.
- `/pet scale <factor>` — resize the pet everywhere (e.g. `/pet scale 0.5`).
- `/pet <slug>` — adopt a specific pet.
- `/pet off` — disable the pet.

In the TUI, `/pet list` opens an interactive picker overlay; in the desktop app
it opens the Cmd+K pet palette.

## Generating a pet (`/hatch`)

Beyond installing pre-made pets from the gallery, Hermes can **generate a brand-new pet** from a text description — its own AI sprite-generation pipeline.

- CLI/TUI: `/hatch <description>` (alias `/generate-pet`), or `hermes pets` → the generate flow.
- Desktop app: the Pokédex-style **generate** UI — an animated egg, hatch FX, and a draft picker.

How generation works (a two-step, cost-bounded flow):

1. **Base drafts** — a handful of cheap, prompt-only "what should this pet look like" variants are generated. You pick one, or remix/retry for a fresh round.
2. **Hatch** — the chosen base is used as a reference image to generate one grounded animation row per Hermes state (idle, thinking, tool use, etc.), which are deterministically sliced into frames and packed into a standard petdex/Codex atlas (8×9 grid of 192×208 cells). The result is a valid spritesheet you keep — and could `petdex submit`.

### Image backend

Generation uses the active [image-generation provider](/user-guide/features/image-generation), but it requires **reference-image grounding** so each animation row stays the same character as the base. Reference-capable backends: **Nous Portal**, **OpenRouter**, **OpenAI** (`gpt-image-2`), and **Krea**. OpenRouter/Nous run a quality-first model chain by default.

- Resolution order prefers Nous Portal → OpenAI → OpenRouter.
- If no reference-capable backend is configured, generation surfaces an actionable error pointing you to `hermes tools` → Image Generation. (Installing/adopting existing gallery pets needs no image backend.)
- Override the backend with the `HERMES_PET_IMAGE_PROVIDER` env var (e.g. `HERMES_PET_IMAGE_PROVIDER=openrouter`).

## Desktop app

In the desktop app you can manage the pet two ways:

- **Cmd+K → "Pets…"** — browse, search, adopt, and toggle pets without leaving
  the keyboard (mirrors the theme picker).
- **Settings → Appearance** — the same gallery plus a **size slider** that
  resizes the floating mascot live as you drag.

Both adopt/toggle/resize the floating mascot in place — size changes apply
instantly; adopting a new pet lights it up within a moment.

### Pop-out overlay

**Shift-click** the floating pet to pop it out into its own transparent,
always-on-top desktop window. Out there it stays visible while Hermes is
minimized (Codex-style), so a glance tells you what the agent is doing.

Gestures once it's popped out:

| Gesture | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Drag** | Move the pet anywhere on screen, even outside the app. Its spot and in/out state persist across restarts. |
| **Single-click** | Open a mini composer to send a prompt to the most recent session — without surfacing the app. |
| **Double-click** | Toggle the app window: minimize it if it's up front, restore it if it's hidden. |
| **Shift-click** | Pop the pet back into the window. |
| **Mail icon** | Appears only when a turn finished while you were away; click to raise the app on the most recent thread (and mark it read). |

Only the popped-out pet shows a **speech bubble** (`working…`, `thinking…`,
`your turn`, …) — in-window the app itself is the surface, so the pet stays
quiet there.

The overlay is a pure puppet of the in-app pet — it carries no separate gateway
connection and never appears in the dock or app switcher.

## Configuration

All settings live under `display.pet` in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
display:
  pet:
    enabled: false        # master on/off (true once you select a pet)
    slug: ""              # active pet; empty = first installed
    render_mode: auto      # auto | kitty | iterm | sixel | unicode | off
    scale: 0.33           # master size knob (relative to native 192x208 frames)
    unicode_cols: 0       # hard override for terminal width (0 = derive from scale)
```

- **`scale`** is the single master size knob. One number shrinks every surface:
  the desktop canvas scales its pixels by it, and the CLI/TUI derive their
  terminal column width from it. The half-block fallback clamps to a legibility
  floor — it can't shrink as far as true-pixel kitty/GUI rendering without
  turning to mush, so the same `scale` looks crisp under kitty but is floored in
  half-blocks.
- **`render_mode: auto`** detects kitty/iTerm2/sixel and falls back to unicode
  half-blocks. Set it explicitly to force a protocol or `off` to disable
  terminal rendering while keeping the pet on the desktop.
- **`unicode_cols`** pins the terminal column width independently of `scale`;
  leave it at `0` to derive width from `scale`.

## Troubleshooting

Run `hermes pets doctor` — it reports:

- the pets directory and which pets are installed,
- `display.pet.enabled`, `display.pet.slug`, and the resolved active pet,
- the configured `render_mode`, the detected terminal graphics protocol, and the
  effective mode for a TTY,
- whether Pillow (used for sprite decoding) is importable.

It prints `✓ ready` once a pet is installed, selected, enabled, and Pillow is
available.

Common gotchas:

- A pet only shows once one is **installed AND selected** (`enabled: true`).
- Inside a pipe/redirect (no TTY), terminal rendering is disabled by design.
- The petdex npm CLI installs to `~/.codex/pets`; Hermes uses its own
  profile-scoped `<HERMES_HOME>/pets/` instead — install through `hermes pets`.
