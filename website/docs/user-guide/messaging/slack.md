# Slack Setup

Connect Hermes Agent to Slack as a bot using Socket Mode. Socket Mode uses WebSockets instead of
public HTTP endpoints, so your Hermes instance doesn't need to be publicly accessible — it works
behind firewalls, on your laptop, or on a private server.

:::warning Classic Slack Apps Deprecated
Classic Slack apps (using RTM API) were **fully deprecated in March 2025**. Hermes uses the modern
Bolt SDK with Socket Mode. If you have an old classic app, you must create a new one following
the steps below.
:::

## Overview

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Library** | `slack-bolt` / `slack_sdk` for Python (Socket Mode) |
| **Connection** | WebSocket — no public URL required |
| **Auth tokens needed** | Bot Token (`xoxb-`) + App-Level Token (`xapp-`) |
| **User identification** | Slack Member IDs (e.g., `U01ABC2DEF3`) |

---

## Step 1: Create a Slack App

The fastest path is to paste a manifest Hermes generates for you. It
declares every built-in slash command (`/btw`, `/stop`, `/model`, …),
every required OAuth scope, every event subscription, and enables Socket
Mode — all at once.

### Option A: From a Hermes-generated manifest (recommended)

1. Generate the manifest. New Slack apps must use Agent view:
   ```bash
   hermes slack manifest --agent-view --write
   ```
   This writes `~/.hermes/slack-manifest.json` and prints paste-in
   instructions. Existing apps that still use Slack's legacy Assistant view
   can omit `--agent-view` until they are ready to migrate.

   To populate Slack's long app description from an existing UTF-8 text or
   Markdown file, add `--long-description-file`:

   ```bash
   hermes slack manifest --agent-view \
     --long-description-file AGENTS.md --write
   ```

   The file contents are preserved exactly within Slack's 175–4,000-character
   range. Use `--long-description "..."` for inline text instead; the inline
   and file options are mutually exclusive and cannot be combined with
   `--slashes-only`.
2. Go to [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) →
   **Create New App** → **From an app manifest**
3. Pick your workspace, paste the JSON contents, review, click **Next**
   → **Create**
4. Skip ahead to **Step 6: Install App to Workspace**. The manifest
   handled scopes, events, and slash commands for you.

### Option B: From scratch (manual)

1. Go to [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click **Create New App**
3. Choose **From scratch**
4. Enter an app name (e.g., "Hermes Agent") and select your workspace
5. Click **Create App**

You'll land on the app's **Basic Information** page. Continue with
Steps 2–6 below.

---

## Step 2: Configure Bot Token Scopes

Navigate to **Features → OAuth & Permissions** in the sidebar. Scroll to **Scopes → Bot Token Scopes** and add the following:

| Scope | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `chat:write` | Send messages as the bot |
| `app_mentions:read` | Detect when @mentioned in channels |
| `channels:history` | Read messages in public channels the bot is in |
| `channels:read` | List and get info about public channels |
| `groups:history` | Read messages in private channels the bot is invited to |
| `im:history` | Read direct message history |
| `im:read` | View basic DM info |
| `im:write` | Open and manage DMs |
| `mpim:history` | Read group direct message (multi-person DM) history |
| `mpim:read` | View basic group DM info |
| `users:read` | Look up user information |
| `files:read` | Read and download attached files, including voice notes/audio |
| `files:write` | Upload files (images, audio, documents) |

:::caution Missing scopes = missing features
Without `channels:history` and `groups:history`, the bot **will not receive messages in channels** —
it will only work in DMs. Without `files:read`, Hermes can chat but **cannot reliably read user-uploaded attachments**.
These are the most commonly missed scopes.
:::

**Optional scopes:**

| Scope | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `groups:read` | List and get info about private channels |
| `assistant:write` | Render the working-state status line ("is thinking…") next to the bot name while it processes a message. Without this scope the `assistant.threads.setStatus` call fails silently and Slack shows its own rotating generic placeholders instead ("Finding answers…", "Reviewing findings…", …) — Hermes never controls the text. Required for `typing_status_text` to have any visible effect. |

---

## Step 3: Enable Socket Mode

Socket Mode lets the bot connect via WebSocket instead of requiring a public URL.

1. In the sidebar, go to **Settings → Socket Mode**
2. Toggle **Enable Socket Mode** to ON
3. You'll be prompted to create an **App-Level Token**:
   - Name it something like `hermes-socket` (the name doesn't matter)
   - Add the **`connections:write`** scope
   - Click **Generate**
4. **Copy the token** — it starts with `xapp-`. This is your `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`

:::tip
You can always find or regenerate app-level tokens under **Settings → Basic Information → App-Level Tokens**.
:::

---

## Step 4: Subscribe to Events

This step is critical — it controls what messages the bot can see.


1. In the sidebar, go to **Features → Event Subscriptions**
2. Toggle **Enable Events** to ON
3. Expand **Subscribe to bot events** and add:

| Event | Required? | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `message.im` | **Yes** | Bot receives direct messages |
| `message.mpim` | **Yes** | Bot receives messages in **group DMs** (multi-person DMs) it's added to |
| `message.channels` | **Yes** | Bot receives messages in **public** channels it's added to |
| `message.groups` | **Recommended** | Bot receives messages in **private** channels it's invited to |
| `app_mention` | **Yes** | Prevents Bolt SDK errors when bot is @mentioned |

4. Click **Save Changes** at the bottom of the page

:::danger Missing event subscriptions is the #1 setup issue
If the bot works in DMs but **not in channels**, you almost certainly forgot to add
`message.channels` (for public channels) and/or `message.groups` (for private channels).
Without these events, Slack simply never delivers channel messages to the bot.
:::


---

## Step 5: Enable the Messages Tab

This step enables direct messages to the bot. Without it, users see **"Sending messages to this app has been turned off"** when trying to DM the bot.

1. In the sidebar, go to **Features → App Home**
2. Scroll to **Show Tabs**
3. Toggle **Messages Tab** to ON
4. Check **"Allow users to send Slash commands and messages from the messages tab"**

:::danger Without this step, DMs are completely blocked
Even with all the correct scopes and event subscriptions, Slack will not allow users to send direct messages to the bot unless the Messages Tab is enabled. This is a Slack platform requirement, not a Hermes configuration issue.
:::

---

## Step 6: Install App to Workspace

1. In the sidebar, go to **Settings → Install App**
2. Click **Install to Workspace**
3. Review the permissions and click **Allow**
4. After authorization, you'll see a **Bot User OAuth Token** starting with `xoxb-`
5. **Copy this token** — this is your `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`

:::tip
If you change scopes or event subscriptions later, you **must reinstall the app** for the changes
to take effect. The Install App page will show a banner prompting you to do so.
:::

---

## Step 7: Find User IDs for the Allowlist

Hermes uses Slack **Member IDs** (not usernames or display names) for the allowlist.

To find a Member ID:

1. In Slack, click on the user's name or avatar
2. Click **View full profile**
3. Click the **⋮** (more) button
4. Select **Copy member ID**

Member IDs look like `U01ABC2DEF3`. You need your own Member ID at minimum.

---

## Step 8: Configure Hermes

Add the following to your `~/.hermes/.env` file:

```bash
# Required
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token-here
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-app-token-here
SLACK_ALLOWED_USERS=U01ABC2DEF3              # Comma-separated Member IDs

# Optional
SLACK_HOME_CHANNEL=C01234567890              # Default channel for cron/scheduled messages
SLACK_HOME_CHANNEL_NAME=general              # Human-readable name for the home channel (optional)
```

Or run the interactive setup:

```bash
hermes gateway setup    # Select Slack when prompted
```

Then start the gateway:

```bash
hermes gateway              # Foreground
hermes gateway install      # Install as a user service
sudo hermes gateway install --system   # Linux only: boot-time system service
```

:::tip Codex reasoning-effort safety
For Codex-backed Slack peer-agent channels, prefer `agent.reasoning_effort: high` or lower. `xhigh`
can spend the entire turn in hidden reasoning and never produce visible assistant text; Hermes now
suppresses those incomplete-turn warnings from the thread and keeps the diagnostics in gateway logs.
:::

---

## Step 9: Invite the Bot to Channels

After starting the gateway, you need to **invite the bot** to any channel where you want it to respond:

```
/invite @Hermes Agent
```

The bot will **not** automatically join channels. You must invite it to each channel individually.

---

## Slash Commands

Every Hermes command (`/btw`, `/stop`, `/new`, `/model`, `/help`, ...)
is a native Slack slash command — exactly the way they work on Telegram
and Discord. Type `/` in Slack and the autocomplete picker lists every
Hermes command with its description.

Under the hood: Hermes ships with a generated Slack app manifest (see
Step 1, Option A) that declares every command in
[`COMMAND_REGISTRY`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/main/hermes_cli/commands.py)
as a slash command. In Socket Mode, Slack routes the command event
through the WebSocket regardless of the manifest's `url` field.

### Agent messaging experience

New Slack apps use Slack's **Agent** messaging experience. Existing Hermes
Assistant apps can migrate by regenerating the manifest with `--agent-view`:

```bash
hermes slack manifest --agent-view --write
```

Update the manifest in **Features → App Manifest**, then reinstall the app if
Slack asks. Agent view cannot be reverted to Assistant view, and users may need
to hard-refresh Slack after the switch. The generated Agent manifest subscribes
to `message.im`, `app_home_opened`, and `app_context_changed`, so Hermes can
identify a Messages-tab DM and receive the user's active Slack context with a
turn. Hermes only supplies that context as a label; it does not read the viewed
channel's history.

### Refreshing slash commands after updates

When Hermes adds new commands (e.g. after `hermes update`), regenerate
the manifest and update your Slack app:

```bash
hermes slack manifest --write
```

Then in Slack:
1. Open [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) →
   your Hermes app
2. **Features → App Manifest → Edit**
3. Paste the new contents of `~/.hermes/slack-manifest.json`
4. **Save**. Slack will prompt to reinstall the app if scopes or slash
   commands changed.

### Legacy `/hermes <subcommand>` still works

For backward compatibility with older manifests, you can still type
`/hermes btw run the tests` — Hermes routes it the same way as `/btw
run the tests`. Free-form questions also work: `/hermes what's the
weather?` is treated as a regular message.

### Using commands inside threads (the `!cmd` prefix)

Slack itself blocks native slash commands inside thread replies — try
`/queue` in a thread and Slack responds with *"/queue is not supported
in threads. Sorry!"* There is no app-side setting that re-enables them;
Slack never delivers them to Hermes.

As a workaround, Hermes recognises a leading `!` as an alternate
command prefix that works in threads (and anywhere else). Type
`!queue`, `!stop`, `!model gpt-5.4`, etc. as a regular thread reply —
Hermes treats it identically to the slash form and replies in the same
thread.

Only the first token is checked against the known command list, so
casual messages like `!nice work` pass through to the agent unchanged.
The bang form also works behind a mention (`@Hermes !stop`) and with
leading whitespace — both dispatch as commands in threads.

Approval prompts (dangerous command / `execute_code` approval) normally
render as interactive buttons. When buttons can't be delivered and
Hermes falls back to a text prompt, the prompt instructs you to reply
with `!approve` / `!deny` — the form that works inside threads.

### Slash replies are ephemeral

Replies to a native slash command (e.g. `/status`, `/help`) are delivered
**ephemerally** — "Only visible to you" — so command output never spams the
channel. The "Running /cmd…" placeholder is replaced with the real reply; long
replies are chunked into follow-up ephemeral messages. Slack caps the reply
flow at 5 posts, so extremely long output is closed with an explicit
truncation notice rather than silently dropped. If the primary ephemeral path
fails, Hermes retries via a second ephemeral API path — a slash reply is never
posted publicly to the channel as a fallback. (Commands typed as regular
messages — `!cmd` in threads, `@Hermes /cmd` — reply as normal visible
messages instead.)

### Clarify prompts (one-tap buttons)

When the agent needs to ask you a multiple-choice question (the `clarify`
tool), Slack renders it as **Block Kit buttons** — one tap per option, plus an
"✏️ Other…" button that switches to free-text mode (your next typed message
becomes the answer). After a tap, the message updates in place to show who
answered and what was chosen; further clicks on the same prompt are ignored.
Button clicks honor the same user authorization as messages, and expired
prompts (gateway restart, timeout) tell you to re-ask instead of silently
eating the click. Open-ended clarify questions render as a plain question and
accept your next typed reply. No configuration needed — this works regardless
of the `rich_blocks` setting.

### Advanced: emit only the slash-commands array

If you maintain your Slack manifest by hand and just want the slash
command list:

```bash
hermes slack manifest --slashes-only > /tmp/slashes.json
```

Paste that array into the `features.slash_commands` key of your
existing manifest.

## How the Bot Responds

Understanding how Hermes behaves in different contexts:

| Context | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **DMs** | Bot responds to every message — no @mention needed |
| **Channels** | Bot **only responds when @mentioned** (e.g., `@Hermes Agent what time is it?`). In channels, Hermes replies in a thread attached to that message. |
| **Threads** | If you @mention Hermes inside an existing thread, it replies in that same thread. Once the bot has an active session in a thread, **subsequent replies in that thread do not require @mention** — the bot follows the conversation naturally. |

:::tip
In channels, always @mention the bot to start a conversation. Once the bot is active in a thread, you can reply in that thread without mentioning it. Outside of threads, messages without @mention are ignored to prevent noise in busy channels.
:::

---

## Configuration Options

Beyond the required environment variables from Step 8, you can customize Slack bot behavior through `~/.hermes/config.yaml`.

### Thread & Reply Behavior

```yaml
platforms:
  slack:
    # Controls how multi-part responses are threaded
    # "off"   — never thread replies to the original message
    # "first" — first chunk threads to user's message (default)
    # "all"   — all chunks thread to user's message
    reply_to_mode: "first"

    extra:
      # Whether to reply in a thread (default: true).
      # When false, channel messages get direct channel replies instead
      # of threads. Messages inside existing threads still reply in-thread.
      reply_in_thread: true

      # Also post thread replies to the main channel
      # (Slack's "Also send to channel" feature).
      # Only the first chunk of the first reply is broadcast.
      reply_broadcast: false

      # Render agent messages as Slack Block Kit blocks (default: false).
      # When true, the final agent message is sent with structured blocks —
      # section headers, dividers, true nested lists (via rich_text), and
      # native Block Kit tables — instead of flat mrkdwn text. A plain-text
      # fallback is always sent alongside for notifications/accessibility.
      # Tables exceeding Slack's limits (100 rows / 20 cols / 10k chars)
      # gracefully fall back to aligned monospace.
      rich_blocks: false

      # Append Slack-native feedback controls to final Block Kit replies.
      # Requires rich_blocks: true. Default: false.
      feedback_buttons: false

      # Suggested prompts pinned at the top of Agent view's Messages tab.
      # Either a list of {title, message} rows, or a titled object:
      # {title: "Start here", prompts: [{title: "Plan", message: "..."}]}
      suggested_prompts: []

      # Title Agent/Assistant DM threads from the first user message.
      # Default: true. Set false to leave Slack's default thread titles.
      assistant_thread_titles: true

      # Accept messages posted by other Slack bots (default: "none").
      # "none" ignores bots, "mentions" accepts a bot message only when
      # that message itself @mentions Hermes, and "all" accepts every
      # other bot. Hermes always ignores its own bot user to prevent
      # self-echoes.
      allow_bots: "none"

      # Continuable-cron delivery surface (default: "thread").
      # "in_channel" delivers a continuable cron job FLAT into the channel
      # (no dedicated thread); pair with reply_in_thread: false (and
      # require_mention: false) so a plain reply continues the job.
      # See the cron guide → "Flat, in-channel continuation".
      cron_continuable_surface: thread
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `platforms.slack.reply_to_mode` | `"first"` | Threading mode for multi-part messages: `"off"`, `"first"`, or `"all"` |
| `platforms.slack.extra.reply_in_thread` | `true` | When `false`, channel messages get direct replies instead of threads. Messages inside existing threads still reply in-thread. |
| `platforms.slack.extra.reply_broadcast` | `false` | When `true`, thread replies are also posted to the main channel. Only the first chunk is broadcast. |
| `platforms.slack.extra.rich_blocks` | `false` | When `true`, agent messages are rendered as [Block Kit](https://docs.slack.dev/block-kit/) blocks (headers, dividers, true nested lists, and native tables). A plain-text fallback is always sent. Tables over Slack's limits fall back to aligned monospace. No app reinstall required — it's a send-side change only. |
| `platforms.slack.extra.feedback_buttons` | `false` | When `true` with `rich_blocks`, appends Slack-native feedback controls to final replies. |
| `platforms.slack.extra.suggested_prompts` | `[]` | Up to four `{title, message}` prompts for Agent/Assistant DM entry points; accepts either a list or `{title, prompts}`. |
| `platforms.slack.extra.assistant_thread_titles` | `true` | When `true`, names Agent/Assistant DM threads from the first user message. |
| `platforms.slack.extra.allow_bots` | `"none"` | Controls messages from other Slack bots: `"none"` ignores them, `"mentions"` accepts a bot message only when **that message itself** @mentions Hermes, and `"all"` accepts all of them. Use `"mentions"` for the safest bot-to-bot collaboration mode. See [Accepting messages from other bots](#accepting-messages-from-other-bots-allow_bots). |
| `platforms.slack.extra.cron_continuable_surface` | `"thread"` | Delivery surface for [continuable cron jobs](../features/cron.md#flat-in-channel-continuation-slack). `"thread"` opens a dedicated thread per delivery (default); `"in_channel"` delivers flat into the channel timeline. Pair `in_channel` with `reply_in_thread: false` (and `require_mention: false`) so a plain channel reply continues the job. |

The equivalent environment variable is `SLACK_ALLOW_BOTS=none|mentions|all`.
When both are set, `platforms.slack.extra.allow_bots` takes precedence. Avoid
`all` when peer bots can answer each other without an explicit mention, because
their own reply policies can still create loops.

### Working-State Status Line

While the agent processes a message, Slack shows a status line next to the bot
name in the thread. By default Hermes sets it to `is thinking...`; customize it
with `typing_status_text` — e.g. a kitten assistant named Ada:

```yaml
platforms:
  slack:
    # Custom working-state status line (default: "is thinking...").
    typing_status_text: "is pouncing… 🐾"
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `platforms.slack.typing_status_text` | `"is thinking..."` | Text of the working-state status line shown while the agent processes a message. Requires the `assistant:write` scope — without it the status call fails silently and Slack renders its own generic placeholder, whatever this is set to. Set `typing_indicator: false` to disable the status line entirely. |

:::note Where the status renders
The custom status appears in the **footer beneath the reply composer** ("*BotName* is thinking…"), not inline in the message list. The inline "Generating response…" / "Finding answers…" lines Slack shows in the message area while an AI app works are **Slack's own rotating indicators** — `assistant.threads.setStatus` does not control those, and both can appear at the same time.
:::

The same key customizes Google Chat's visible working-state marker message
(`platforms.google_chat.typing_status_text`, default `"Hermes is thinking…"`) —
note that on Google Chat it is a real posted message that gets patched into the
reply, not an ephemeral status.

### Live Status (per-tool)

By default the status line updates **live as the agent works**: instead of a
static `is thinking...`, it shows what the agent is doing right now — `is
running pytest tests/…`, `is reading docs/api.md…`, `is searching the web for
slack api limits…`. Between tool calls it reverts to the static text. This
rides the existing status-refresh cadence, so it makes no additional Slack API
calls, and it works even with `tool_progress: off` (Slack's default) — unlike
progress bubbles, the status line is ephemeral and leaves nothing behind in
the channel.

Control it with `display.live_status` (global or per-platform):

```yaml
display:
  platforms:
    slack:
      # full = verb + argument ("is running pytest…")   [default]
      # verb = verb only ("is running…") — hides commands/paths,
      #        useful in shared or customer-facing channels
      # off  = static text (typing_status_text or "is thinking...")
      live_status: full
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `display.live_status` | `"full"` | Live per-tool status line. `full` shows verb + argument preview; `verb` shows the verb only (keeps file paths and commands out of shared channels); `off` restores the static text. Requires the `assistant:write` scope, same as the static status line. |

### Session Isolation

```yaml
# Global setting — applies to Slack and all other platforms
group_sessions_per_user: true
```

When `true` (the default), each user in a shared channel gets their own isolated conversation session. Two people talking to Hermes in `#general` will have separate histories and contexts.

Set to `false` if you want a collaborative mode where the entire channel shares one conversation session. Be aware this means users share context growth and token costs, and one user's `/reset` clears the session for everyone.

### Mention & Trigger Behavior

```yaml
slack:
  # Require @mention in channels (this is the default behavior;
  # the Slack adapter enforces @mention gating in channels regardless,
  # but you can set this explicitly for consistency with other platforms)
  require_mention: true

  # Prevent thread auto-engagement: only reply to channel messages that
  # contain an explicit @mention. With this OFF (default), Slack can
  # "auto-engage" — remembering past mentions in a thread and following
  # up on bot-message replies, and resuming active sessions without a
  # fresh mention. With strict_mention ON, every new channel message
  # must @mention the bot before Hermes will respond.
  strict_mention: false

  # Ignore messages addressed to another user: when a channel or thread
  # message *opens* by @mentioning someone other than the bot (e.g.
  # "@rasha can you take this?"), stay silent unless the bot is also
  # mentioned. Only a *leading* mention counts as "addressed to" — a
  # message that references someone mid-sentence ("loop in @rasha")
  # still reaches the bot. Overrides free_response_channels and thread
  # auto-engagement. Opt-in; default off. Env: SLACK_IGNORE_OTHER_USER_MENTIONS.
  ignore_other_user_mentions: false

  # Require an explicit @mention for THREAD replies, while leaving
  # top-level channel messages governed by require_mention /
  # free_response_channels. Narrower than strict_mention: use it when a
  # free-response bot should not join every follow-up in busy threads.
  # Opt-in; default off. Env: SLACK_THREAD_REQUIRE_MENTION.
  thread_require_mention: false

  # Per-channel force-mention override — the opposite direction of
  # free_response_channels. Channels listed here ALWAYS require an
  # explicit @mention, even when require_mention is false globally.
  # Ongoing conversations still auto-follow (mentioned threads, active
  # sessions, bot-authored threads). Comma-separated IDs or a list.
  # Env: SLACK_REQUIRE_MENTION_CHANNELS.
  require_mention_channels: ""

  # Custom mention patterns that trigger the bot
  # (in addition to the default @mention detection)
  mention_patterns:
    - "hey hermes"
    - "hermes,"

  # Text prepended to every outgoing message
  reply_prefix: ""
```

:::tip When to use `strict_mention`
Set this to `true` in busy workspaces where Slack's default "the bot remembers this thread" behavior surprises users — for example, a long tech-support thread where the bot helped at the start and you'd rather it stay silent unless explicitly pinged again. DMs and active interactive sessions are unaffected.
:::

:::tip When to use `ignore_other_user_mentions`
Set this to `true` when the bot follows busy threads (via thread auto-engagement or `free_response_channels`) and butts in on messages humans address to each other. It is a narrower tool than `strict_mention`: plain follow-ups in an engaged thread still get answers; only messages that open by @mentioning another person are skipped. **1:1 DMs are unaffected**; group DMs (MPIMs) and channels both apply it, matching the shared-surface policy below. Broadcast tokens (`@here`, `@channel`) and channel references address the room, not a person, so they are never skipped.
:::

:::info
Slack supports both patterns: `@mention` required to start a conversation by default, but you can opt specific channels out via `SLACK_FREE_RESPONSE_CHANNELS` (comma-separated channel IDs) or `slack.free_response_channels` in `config.yaml`. Once the bot has an active session in a thread, subsequent thread replies do not require a mention. In **1:1 DMs** the bot always responds without needing a mention.
:::

:::caution Group DMs (MPIMs) are shared surfaces, not 1:1 DMs
A **1:1 direct message** is a private conversation with one person, so it is mention-exempt. A **group DM (MPIM / multi-person DM)** is a *shared surface* — multiple people can see and trigger the bot — so it obeys the same operator controls as a channel: `require_mention`, `strict_mention`, `free_response_channels`, and `allowed_channels` all apply, and the bot only adds `:eyes:`/`:white_check_mark:` reactions when it is actually `@mentioned`. To let the bot respond freely in a specific group DM, add its channel ID (starts with `G`) to `free_response_channels`.
:::

#### Which mention option do I want?

The gating options compose — each answers a different question:

| Option | Question it answers | Default | Scope |
|--------|--------------------|---------|-------|
| `require_mention` | Do **top-level channel messages** need an @mention? | `true` | All channels |
| `free_response_channels` | Which channels are exempt from `require_mention`? | none | Listed channels |
| `require_mention_channels` | Which channels ALWAYS need an @mention, even when `require_mention` is `false` or the channel is free-response? Wins over both. | none | Listed channels |
| `thread_require_mention` | Do **thread replies** need an @mention, even when top-level messages don't? Mentioned threads are not remembered. | `false` | Threads only |
| `strict_mention` | Does **every** channel message (top-level and thread) need a fresh @mention? Disables all auto-follow: mentioned-thread memory, bot-reply follow-ups, active-session resume. | `false` | All channels + threads |
| `ignore_other_user_mentions` | Should a message that **opens by @mentioning someone else** (`@rasha can you take this?`) be skipped? Overrides free-response and thread auto-follow; mid-sentence references still reach the bot. | `false` | Channels + group DMs |

Rules of thumb: `strict_mention` is the broadest hammer; `thread_require_mention` quiets busy threads without touching top-level gating; `require_mention_channels` re-tightens individual channels on an otherwise free-response bot; `ignore_other_user_mentions` only skips messages explicitly addressed to another person. 1:1 DMs always respond and are unaffected by all of these.

### Accepting messages from other bots (`allow_bots`)

By default Hermes ignores every message authored by another Slack bot or app (including Workflow Builder posts). For multi-agent workspaces — several Hermes instances or peer bots collaborating in one channel — opt in with `allow_bots`:

```yaml
platforms:
  slack:
    extra:
      # "none" (default) — ignore all bot/app-authored messages
      # "mentions"       — accept a bot message only when THAT message
      #                    @mentions this bot
      # "all"            — accept every bot message (except the bot's own)
      allow_bots: mentions
```

Env equivalent: `SLACK_ALLOW_BOTS=none|mentions|all` (the config key wins when both are set). Unknown values are treated as `none`.

How `mentions` mode gates:

- A peer-bot message is accepted **only when the message itself contains a current `@mention` of this bot** — in its text or its Block Kit blocks. Thread history does not count: a bot having been mentioned earlier in the thread, replies to the bot's own messages, and active thread sessions do **not** admit later unmentioned peer-bot messages. This is deliberate — it is what breaks agent-to-agent ack/status loops.
- Human messages are unaffected; normal mention gating applies to them.
- Hermes always ignores its own messages, in every mode, to prevent self-echo loops.

`mentions` is the recommended mode for bot-to-bot collaboration: each agent must explicitly summon the other per turn. Avoid `all` unless every peer bot's own reply policy is loop-safe — two bots that answer everything will answer each other forever. Detection covers labeled bot messages (`bot_id`, `subtype: bot_message`), app-originated events, and unlabeled bot *users* (probed via `users.info`), so peer Hermes agents are filtered consistently across workspaces.

For strict multi-bot deployments, pair with `require_mention: true` and `strict_mention: true` — see the smoke-check profile below.

### Reaction Triggers (`reaction_triggers`)

By default, emoji reactions are acknowledged and dropped — a 👍 on a bot
message does nothing. Set `slack.reaction_triggers` to route reactions into
the agent loop (requires the `reactions:read` scope plus the
`reaction_added`/`reaction_removed` bot event subscriptions in your Slack app
manifest — regenerate with `hermes slack manifest`):

```yaml
slack:
  # Opt-in. false/absent (default) = reactions are acked and dropped.
  # true = any reaction ON THE BOT'S OWN MESSAGES routes to the agent.
  reaction_triggers: true
  # Or an explicit emoji allowlist — only these names route, and they may
  # target ANY message (emoji-handoff workflows, e.g. :task: to capture):
  # reaction_triggers: [white_check_mark, thumbsup, task]
  # Optional handoff target: respond in this channel (top-level) or thread
  # (C123:<thread_ts>) instead of the reacted-to message's thread.
  # reaction_trigger_target: C0123456789
```

Environment equivalents: `SLACK_REACTION_TRIGGERS` (`true`/`all` or a
comma-separated list) and `SLACK_REACTION_TRIGGER_TARGET`.

Behavior:

- The reaction arrives as a normal agent turn with text
  `reaction:added:👍` / `reaction:removed:👍` (common Slack names are
  translated to unicode; unknown names pass through as-is, e.g.
  `reaction:added:custom-emoji`), threaded under
  the reacted-to message so the agent sees what was reacted to and the
  turn lands in the same session as a reply would.
- The reactor becomes the message's user, so **user authorization and
  `allowed_channels` gating apply exactly as for typed messages** — a
  random user's reaction cannot trigger the agent anywhere their message
  couldn't.
- With `reaction_triggers: true`, only reactions on the bot's **own**
  messages route (approve/acknowledge flows). With an explicit emoji
  allowlist, the listed emojis route from any message.
- The bot's own lifecycle reactions (`:eyes:` etc.) never feed back.
- Independent of this opt-in, every human reaction fires the
  `reaction:added`/`reaction:removed` [gateway hooks](../features/hooks.md#available-events)
  for observers that don't need agent turns.

### Peer-Agent Smoke Check

For multi-bot Slack deployments that rely on strict per-turn mentions, keep the following profile:

```yaml
slack:
  require_mention: true
  strict_mention: true
  allow_bots: mentions
  allowed_channels: ""
```

After gateway config changes, deploys, or restarts, run this synthetic smoke target:

```bash
uv run --frozen pytest -q tests/gateway/test_slack_peer_agent_smoke.py -o addopts=''
```

This target uses in-process synthetic Slack events only. It does not send live Slack messages and does not require real bot tokens by default.

Failure buckets:

- `config:` `test_peer_agent_smoke_preflight_contract` caught a profile mismatch (`require_mention`, `strict_mention`, `allow_bots`, or `allowed_channels`).
- `platform_connectivity:` the adapter/client was not initialized, so routing smoke is not a trustworthy signal yet.
- `bot_identity:` the adapter never resolved its bot user ID, so current-message mention checks cannot work.
- `routing_logic:` the Slack adapter regressed on one of the peer-agent invariants (human mention routing, peer-bot ignore, explicit peer mention admit, or passive ack/status/error suppression).

If this target passes but a live workspace still misroutes messages, investigate Slack token/workspace connectivity and runtime deployment state outside the routing logic itself.

### Channel allowlist (`allowed_channels`)

Restrict the bot to a fixed set of Slack channels — useful when the bot is invited to many channels but should only respond in a few. When set, messages from channels NOT in this list are **silently ignored**, even if the bot is `@mentioned`.

**1:1 DMs are exempt** from this filter, so authorized users can always reach the bot in a direct message. **Group DMs (MPIMs) are not exempt** — like channels, an MPIM must be on the allowlist (its ID starts with `G`) or its messages are dropped.

```yaml
slack:
  allowed_channels:
    - "C0123456789"   # #ops
    - "C0987654321"   # #incident-response
```

Or via env var (comma-separated):

```bash
SLACK_ALLOWED_CHANNELS="C0123456789,C0987654321"
```

Behavior:

- Empty / unset → no restriction (fully backward compatible).
- Non-empty → channel ID must be on the list, or the message is dropped before any other gating (mention requirement, `free_response_channels`, etc.) runs.
- Slack channel IDs start with `C` (public), `G` (private), or `D` (DM). Look them up via the Slack UI's "Open channel details" → "About" panel, or via the API.

See also: [admin/user slash command split](../../reference/slash-commands.md#permissions-and-adminuser-split).

### Unauthorized User Handling

```yaml
slack:
  # What happens when an unauthorized user (not in SLACK_ALLOWED_USERS) DMs the bot
  # "pair"   — prompt them for a pairing code (default)
  # "ignore" — silently drop the message
  unauthorized_dm_behavior: "pair"
```

You can also set this globally for all platforms:

```yaml
unauthorized_dm_behavior: "pair"
```

The platform-specific setting under `slack:` takes precedence over the global setting.

### Voice Transcription

```yaml
# Global setting — enable/disable automatic transcription of incoming voice messages
stt_enabled: true
```

When `true` (the default), incoming audio messages are automatically transcribed using the configured STT provider before being processed by the agent.

### Full Example

```yaml
# Global gateway settings
group_sessions_per_user: true
unauthorized_dm_behavior: "pair"
stt_enabled: true

# Slack-specific settings
slack:
  require_mention: true
  unauthorized_dm_behavior: "pair"

# Platform config
platforms:
  slack:
    reply_to_mode: "first"
    extra:
      reply_in_thread: true
      reply_broadcast: false
```

## Home Channel

Set `SLACK_HOME_CHANNEL` to a channel ID where Hermes will deliver scheduled messages,
cron job results, and other proactive notifications. To find a channel ID:

1. Right-click the channel name in Slack
2. Click **View channel details**
3. Scroll to the bottom — the Channel ID is shown there

```bash
SLACK_HOME_CHANNEL=C01234567890
```

Make sure the bot has been **invited to the channel** (`/invite @Hermes Agent`).

### Cron delivery targeting

Cron jobs (see the [cron guide](../features/cron.md#delivery-options)) can target Slack three ways:

| `deliver:` value | Where it lands |
|------------------|----------------|
| `slack` | The home channel (`SLACK_HOME_CHANNEL`) |
| `slack:C0123456789` | A specific channel by ID |
| `slack:U0123456789` | That user's **DM** — the bare user ID is resolved to a DM conversation automatically (requires the `im:write` scope) |

Delivery works even when the cron process isn't co-located with the gateway — Hermes falls back to a standalone Web API sender using `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`. `MEDIA:` attachments in the cron output are uploaded as native Slack file shares to the same target.

### Sending messages and media (`send_message`)

The agent's `send_message` tool accepts the same target shapes: a channel ID (`C…`/`G…`), a DM conversation (`D…`), or a bare user ID (`U…`/`W…`), which is resolved to the user's DM on every send path — text, media, and interactive prompts alike. `MEDIA:<path>` attachments (images, PDFs, documents) upload as native file shares; when a short message accompanies a single attachment it rides as the file's caption instead of a separate message. Missing files are reported per-file as warnings rather than failing the whole send.

---

## Multi-Workspace Support

Hermes can connect to **multiple Slack workspaces** simultaneously using a single gateway instance. Each workspace is authenticated independently with its own bot user ID.

### Configuration

Provide multiple bot tokens as a **comma-separated list** in `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`:

```bash
# Multiple bot tokens — one per workspace
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-workspace1-token,xoxb-workspace2-token,xoxb-workspace3-token

# A single app-level token is still used for Socket Mode
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-app-token
```

Or in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
platforms:
  slack:
    token: "xoxb-workspace1-token,xoxb-workspace2-token"
```

### OAuth Token File

In addition to tokens in the environment or config, Hermes also loads tokens from an **OAuth token file** at:

```
~/.hermes/slack_tokens.json
```

This file is a JSON object mapping team IDs to token entries:

```json
{
  "T01ABC2DEF3": {
    "token": "xoxb-workspace-token-here",
    "team_name": "My Workspace"
  }
}
```

Tokens from this file are merged with any tokens specified via `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`. Duplicate tokens are automatically deduplicated.

### How it works

- The **first token** in the list is the primary token, used for the Socket Mode connection (AsyncApp).
- Each token is authenticated via `auth.test` on startup. The gateway maps each `team_id` to its own `WebClient` and `bot_user_id`.
- When a message arrives, Hermes uses the correct workspace-specific client to respond.
- The primary `bot_user_id` (from the first token) is used for backward compatibility with features that expect a single bot identity.

---

## Voice Messages

Hermes supports voice on Slack:

- **Incoming:** Voice/audio messages are automatically transcribed using the configured STT provider: local `faster-whisper`, Groq Whisper (`GROQ_API_KEY`), or OpenAI Whisper (`VOICE_TOOLS_OPENAI_KEY`)
- **Outgoing:** TTS responses are sent as audio file attachments

---

## Per-Channel Prompts

Assign ephemeral system prompts to specific Slack channels. The prompt is injected at runtime on every turn — never persisted to transcript history — so changes take effect immediately.

```yaml
slack:
  channel_prompts:
    "C01RESEARCH": |
      You are a research assistant. Focus on academic sources,
      citations, and concise synthesis.
    "C02ENGINEERING": |
      Code review mode. Be precise about edge cases and
      performance implications.
```

Keys are Slack channel IDs (find them via channel details → "About" → scroll to bottom). All messages in the matching channel get the prompt injected as an ephemeral system instruction.

## Per-Channel Skill Bindings

Auto-load a skill whenever a new session starts in a specific channel or DM. Unlike per-channel prompts (which are injected on every turn), skill bindings inject the skill content as a user message at **session start** — it becomes part of the conversation history and does not need to be reloaded on subsequent turns.

This is ideal for DMs or channels with a dedicated purpose (flashcards, a domain-specific Q&A bot, a support triage channel, etc.) where you don't want the model's own skill selector to decide whether to load on every short reply.

```yaml
slack:
  channel_skill_bindings:
    # DM channel — always runs in "german-flashcards" mode
    - id: "D0ATH9TQ0G6"
      skills:
        - german-flashcards
    # Research channel — preload multiple skills in order
    - id: "C01RESEARCH"
      skills:
        - arxiv
        - writing-plans
    # Short form: single skill as a string
    - id: "C02SUPPORT"
      skill: hubspot-on-demand
```

Notes:
- The binding matches by channel ID. For threaded messages in a bound channel, the thread inherits the parent channel's binding.
- The skill is loaded only at session start (new session or after auto-reset). If you change the binding, run `/new` or wait for the session to auto-reset for it to take effect.
- Combine with `channel_prompts` for per-channel tone/constraints on top of the skill's instructions.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Bot doesn't respond to DMs | Verify `message.im` is in your event subscriptions and the app is reinstalled |
| Bot works in DMs but not in channels | **Most common issue.** Add `message.channels` and `message.groups` to event subscriptions, reinstall the app, and invite the bot to the channel with `/invite @Hermes Agent` |
| Bot doesn't respond to @mentions in channels | 1) Check `message.channels` event is subscribed. 2) Bot must be invited to the channel. 3) Ensure `channels:history` scope is added. 4) Reinstall the app after scope/event changes |
| Bot ignores messages in private channels | Add both the `message.groups` event subscription and `groups:history` scope, then reinstall the app and `/invite` the bot |
| Bot doesn't respond in group DMs (multi-person DMs) | Add the `message.mpim` event subscription and the `mpim:history` scope (plus `mpim:read`), then **reinstall** the app. Without `message.mpim`, Slack never delivers group-DM messages to the bot — even though 1:1 DMs work. |
| "Sending messages to this app has been turned off" in DMs | Enable the **Messages Tab** in App Home settings (see Step 5) |
| "not_authed" or "invalid_auth" errors | Regenerate your Bot Token and App Token, update `.env` |
| Bot responds but can't post in a channel | Invite the bot to the channel with `/invite @Hermes Agent` |
| Bot can chat but can't read uploaded images/files | Add `files:read`, then **reinstall** the app. Hermes now surfaces attachment access diagnostics in-chat when Slack returns scope/auth/permission failures. |
| `missing_scope` error | Add the required scope in OAuth & Permissions, then **reinstall** the app |
| Socket disconnects frequently | Check your network; Bolt auto-reconnects but unstable connections cause lag |
| Changed scopes/events but nothing changed | You **must reinstall** the app to your workspace after any scope or event subscription change |

### Quick Checklist

If the bot isn't working in channels, verify **all** of the following:

1. ✅ `message.channels` event is subscribed (for public channels)
2. ✅ `message.groups` event is subscribed (for private channels)
3. ✅ `app_mention` event is subscribed
4. ✅ `channels:history` scope is added (for public channels)
5. ✅ `groups:history` scope is added (for private channels)
6. ✅ App was **reinstalled** after adding scopes/events
7. ✅ Bot was **invited** to the channel (`/invite @Hermes Agent`)
8. ✅ You are **@mentioning** the bot in your message

## Security

:::warning
**Always set `SLACK_ALLOWED_USERS`** with the Member IDs of authorized users. Without this setting,
the gateway will **deny all messages** by default as a safety measure. Never share your bot tokens —
treat them like passwords.
:::

- Tokens should be stored in `~/.hermes/.env` (file permissions `600`)
- Rotate tokens periodically via the Slack app settings
- Audit who has access to your Hermes config directory
- Socket Mode means no public endpoint is exposed — one less attack surface
